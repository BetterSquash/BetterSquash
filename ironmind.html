					<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
					<hr style="border-color: #560BAD; border-width: 3px; width:75%" class="mb-5">
						<div class="text-left">
							<p><span style="color:#560BAD"><strong>&#10148;</strong></span> The Routine Timer app has its own webpage with its own <a href="routinetimer.html#faqs">FAQ</a> section.</p>
							<hr>
							<h4>Equipment & Space Requirements</h4>
							<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>Do I need any special equipment to perform these routines?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>Besides a standard squash racket and suitable balls (See my <a href="rightball.html">Use The Right Ball</a> guide), no special equipment is required. However, having a few extra balls, with one held in your non-racket hand to keep it warm) can help maintain momentum, and using A4 paper targets is occasionally recommended.</em></p>
							</div>
							<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>How much court time should I book for these routines?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>I recommend booking a 45-minute slot for each 30-40 minute routine. This gives you time to perform the full routine properly and even have some time left over at the end, to repeat any drills that you feel focus on your weaknesses.</em></p>
							</div>
							<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>Can I practice these routines on a racquetball or other similar court?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>Yes, I suppose you could, but obviously it's better to use a proper squash court.</em></p>
							</div>
							<hr>
							<h4>Skill Level & Progression</h4>
							<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>What makes the Solo Routines programme different from other squash training programmes?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>The Solo Routines programme is uniquely structured around themed routines and focused drills that are designed to improve specific aspects of your game. Each routine comes with a detailed PDF guide sheet, an explainer video, and access to the Routine Timer app, ensuring you get the most out of every practice session.</em></p>
							</div>
							<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>Can I use these routines if I’m a complete beginner?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>I don't advise using the Club Players Sets.  They are designed for players who play competitive club squash. However, some beginners have purchased Set One and reported that they benefited from it.  Sometime in 2025, I will be releasing a Beginners set, but I have no release date for that.</em></p>
							</div>
							<!--<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>How do I know which set to start with?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>If you’re a competitive club player, start with Club Players: Set 1. If you’re new to squash or returning after a long break, the Beginners: Set 01 is more appropriate. Each set is designed to cater to different skill levels.</em></p>
							</div>-->
							<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>I'm returning to squash after years away. Is this programme suitable for me?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>Yes, especially if you had previous experience. The Club Players: Set 1 can help you rebuild your skills methodically. Focus on quality over quantity as you regain your touch.</em></p>
							</div>
							<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>How quickly should I expect to see improvement?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>Most players notice improvements in their ball control within 2-3 weeks of consistent practice (2-3 sessions per week). However, significant improvements typically take 6-8 weeks of regular practice.</em></p>
							</div>
							<!--<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>How do I know when I'm ready to move from beginner routines to club player routines?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>You're ready to progress when you can consistently complete beginner routines with good control and minimal errors. If you can maintain good length and accuracy for 80% of your shots, consider moving up.</em></p>
							</div>-->
							<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>How long does each routine typically last?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>Between 30 to 40 minutes.</em></p>
							</div>
							<!--<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>Are the routines suitable for beginners or only for advanced players?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>Currently, the Solo Routines set is designed for club players, but a new series for Beginners and a second set for club players are being created.  There is not fixed release date.</em></p>
							</div>-->
							<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>How often should I practice each routine?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>Honestly, that's a tough one to answer.  Ideally between 5 and 10 times per month.</em></p>
							</div>
							<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>Can I mix routines in a single training session?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>Yes, players should feel free to adapt and adjust their training to suit <em>THEIR</em> needs.</em></p>
							</div>
							<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>Do the routines focus on specific skills or overall improvement?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>Each routine is themed and generally is focused on certain aspects of ball control.</em></p>
							</div>
							<hr>
							<h4>Programme Implementation</h4>
							<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>How often should I practice these routines?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>For optimal results, I recommend 1-2 solo practice sessions per week. This frequency allows for skill development while preventing burnout.</em></p>
							</div>
							<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>Should I repeat the same routine multiple times or rotate through all 12?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>I recommend performing each routine twice before moving onto the next one.  Rotate through all 12 routines to build a broad foundation. Once you identify specific areas needing improvement, you can focus more on those particular routines.</em></p>
							</div>
							<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>Can I modify the routines to match my specific weaknesses?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>Absolutely! While the routines are designed to be comprehensive, feel free to extend sections that address your weaknesses or modify drills to target specific aspects of your game.</em></p>
							</div>
							<hr>
							<h4>Technical Integration</h4>
							<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>Can I download the videos for offline viewing?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>The explainer videos are hosted on YouTube as unlisted.  It is possible to use other websites and services to download, but I don't offer that as part of the package.</em></p>
							</div>
							<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>How do I access the Discord server, and what kind of support can I expect there?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>The Discord invitation link is included in your welcome email and on the PDF sheet. Discord can be accessed via a browser or an app. An account is necessary to access a Discord server. In the Discord server, you can ask questions, share your experiences, and get direct advice from Phillip and other Solo Routines users.</em></p>
							</div>
							<hr>
							<h4>Using Solo Routines with Others</h4>
							<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>Can I use these routines as part of a coaching session with my students?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>For coaching purposes, you should purchase the Commercial license, which permits sharing the routines with students in your facility.</em></p>
							</div>
							<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>Can I practice these routines with a partner?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>While designed as solo routines, many drills can be adapted for partner practice. The Discord community is a great place to ask about partner adaptations for specific routines.</em></p>
							</div>
							<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>As a club administrator, how can I best implement these routines for our members?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>A Commercial license allows you to post the routine on your noticeboard and make a reasonable number of photocopies to distribute WITHIN your facility. Consider posting a "Routine of the Month" on your noticeboard and organising designated solo practice sessions where members can work on the routines together but individually.</em></p>
							</div>
							<hr>
							<h4>Routine Timer App</h4>
							<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>Is the Routine Timer app easy to use?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>Yes, the Routine Timer app is user-friendly and designed to guide you through each routine with visual and audio cues.</em></p>
							</div>
							<hr>
							<h4>Payment, Licensing & Access</h4>
							<button class="accordion mb-2"><strong>What payment methods are accepted?</strong></button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>Major credit cards and other secure payment methods are accepted through our Stripe payment gateway.</em></p>
							</div>

						<p class="mt-3">"<em>Phillip's solo sessions have been a real game-changer for me. They have provided a great way to build my ball control & swing skills, and expand my range of shots beyond my previous repertoire. They have enabled me to plot a path of gradual, consistent improvement in my match performance, & also reduce injury niggles such as the stiff racket arm elbow that used to bother me, but now far less.</em>"<br><strong>T.O, Singapore - May 2024</strong></p>

					<h2>My Approach to Solo Drilling</h2>
					<hr style="border-color: #560BAD; border-width: 3px; width:75%" class="mb-5">
					<div class="text-left">
						<p class="mt-3">Keeping your mind engaged is essential when practicing solo drills. That’s why most of my drills last less than three minutes and incorporate the <em>Set</em> and <em>Mega-Set</em> concepts.</p>
						<p class="mt-3">Drill repetition is also key—it ensures you spend enough time on each drill without it becoming monotonous.</p>
						<p class="mt-3">Throughout the year, I adjust the difficulty, type, focus, and duration of drills. During summer, foundational drills take priority, while in-season training includes more aggressive and kill-oriented drills.</p>

					<div class="text-left">
							<p class="mt-2"><strong><span style="color: #560BAD">&#10148;</span></strong> Have a plan.  Hopefully, you are about to sign up for my Solo Routines programme, so that's taken care of.  But it is also a good idea to read and understand the routine BEFORE you go onto the court. I'm not saying memorise it, but at least have read it first.</p>
							<p class="mt-2"><strong><span style="color: #560BAD">&#10148;</span></strong> Always heat up properly before you start drilling.  By taking the solo drilling seriously you will maximise your time and train yourself to always focus on court.</p>
							<p class="mt-2"><strong><span style="color: #560BAD">&#10148;</span></strong> Hold a spare ball of the same dot colour and condition as the ball you are using in your non-hitting hand.  This will ensure minimum disruption if you break a ball during the routine.</p>
							<p class="mt-2"><strong><span style="color: #560BAD">&#10148;</span></strong> Using targets is a great way to focus your mind.  But not everybody benefits from them.  Some players find that they become worried when they don't hit them.  USe them if they feel right for you.</p>
							<p class="mt-2"><strong><span style="color: #560BAD">&#10148;</span></strong> Use which ever routine feels suitable for you that training session.  You do not have to use the same one for the whole month.</p>
							<p class="mt-2"><strong><span style="color: #560BAD">&#10148;</span></strong> I would recommend a minimum of one solo training session per week and up to four, but you will need to adjust that to suit your needs and objectives.</p>
							<p class="mt-2"><strong><span style="color: #560BAD">&#10148;</span></strong> Many solo drills can be performed with a partner sharing the court, so I recommend finding a training partner to share the cost of the court.  <strong>Just don't be tempted to play games instead.</strong></p>
