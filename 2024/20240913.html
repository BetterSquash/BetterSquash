<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Many people find it difficult to decide what solo drills they should perform.  They often. repeat the same ones, which in itself is not a bad thing, but this often leads to boredom and more importantly a lack of improvement.</p>
<p>In this short article, I show you how to use a pack of playing cards along with a predefined drill list to add some variety and surprise into your solo drill training.</p>
<p>A PDF explainer is available for you to print and refer to.  The PDF contains the instructions, the example draw, the sample drill list and a black drill list for you to complete: <a href="/pdf/rsr.pdf">Randomised Solo Routines PDF</a>(150Kb).</p>

<p class="imagep">I felt like a magician as I was recording this video.</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Here are the simple instructions</p>
<ol>
	<li>Take a pack of cards.  I use French, but Spanish and German would work just as well.
		<ul>
			<li>Separate the Aces, twos and threes into a pile. This is Pile 1.</li>
			<li>Separate the four to 10 cards into another pile This is Pile 2.</li>
			<li>Separate the Jack, Queen and King cards into a third pile. This is Pile 3.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Shuffle all three piles independently.
	<li>Take pile 1 and place all the cards in a vertical line on the table/floor in front of you. This is column 1.</li>
	<li>Take pile 2 and place one card next to each of the cards you have just placed.  Discard the remaining cards. This is column 2.</li>
	<li>Take pile 3 and place them next to the other two cards. This is column 3.</li>
	<li>You now should have 3 columns of cards with 12 rows.</li>
	<li>Column 1 is the Drill Minutes.  How long you perform each drill.  Ace is one minute, the Two is 2 minutes and obviously, the three is 3 minutes.  Adjust that to suit your needs.  Make each card more or less time - it’s your choice.</li>
	<li>Column 3 is the Drill Mode:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Power:</strong> means trying to hit the ball as hard as you can, but still be able to keep the drill going.</li>
				<li><strong>Control:</strong> means being as precise as possible with the ball, maybe even using targets.</li>
				<li><strong>Technique:</strong> means focusing your attention on using good technique.</li>
			</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Column 2 is the Drill List.  Using the Drill List below, see which drill you should perform.  You have one veto meaning you can replace one drill with another random one.</li>
</ol>
