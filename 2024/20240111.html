	  		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Let's start with the obvious question: What is a deadball shot? A deadball shot is one where you drop and hit the the ball or throw and hit the ball.  Not one where you hit a few in a row.  A deadball shot is played one at a time. "<em>But that doesn't recreate a real situation, Phillip</em>" you say. And you are right.  But plenty of things don't recreate real situations, but we still do them and they still bring benefits.  <a class="norm" href="/2022/20220620.html">Figure of eights <svg height="16px" width="16px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-name="Layer 1" viewBox="0 0 100 125" x="0px" y="0px"><path d="M34,66.69H65a2,2,0,0,0,2-2v-8a2,2,0,0,0-2-2H52.49l35-35.08a2,2,0,0,0,0-2.86L81.88,11.1a2,2,0,0,0-2.8,0L44,46.2v-12a2,2,0,0,0-2-2H34a2,2,0,0,0-2,2V64.69A2,2,0,0,0,34,66.69Z"/><path d="M87.13,55.51h-8a1.94,1.94,0,0,0-2,1.89V77.59H22.05V22.47H42.23a1.94,1.94,0,0,0,1.89-2v-8a1.94,1.94,0,0,0-1.89-2H12a1.8,1.8,0,0,0-1.26.52l-.06.05-.05.06a1.8,1.8,0,0,0-.52,1.26V87.66a1.84,1.84,0,0,0,.52,1.26l.05.06.06,0a1.8,1.8,0,0,0,1.26.52H87.23A1.84,1.84,0,0,0,88.5,89l0,0,.06-.06a1.83,1.83,0,0,0,.51-1.26V57.4A1.94,1.94,0,0,0,87.13,55.51Z"/></svg></a> come to mind.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">By hitting a deadball, you have the opportunity to focus totally on the swing, timing and control of hitting the ball, without worrying about moving towards the ball, and judging and adjusting the distance to the ball, at least not in the same way as dropping the ball and hitting it.  Admittedly, it's not as satisfying as continuous hitting, but it serves a different purpose.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">It's also important to note that these drills are not designed for complete beginners or very new players.  Those players could do them, but only if they have nobody else to practice with.</p>

		<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Using Targets</h3>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Before I explain each drill, I want to briefly talk about targets.  I recommend using targets.  However, not everybody responds well to using targets.  Over the years, I found some pupils perform worse when using them for two reasons.  Firstly, because they focus totally on hitting the target and NOT on swinging well.  They adjust everything to simply hit the target, and at first that sounds right, but in the long-term it won't help your squash.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Secondly, some people become disheartened if they don't hit their expected number of shots.  This is a personality thing and should be accepted as is. I suggest you try using targets and see how they work for you.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">One final point about targets.  Smaller is NOT better.  Don't think that by using a squash ball box as a target you are challenging yourself more than somebody with a bigger target.  Use targets that are big enough you can hit one in every set.  Below are three examples of targets for; Foundation, Competitive and Advanced levels. The foundation level is the whole area from the tape to the back wall, and all are one racket length from the side wall.</p>
			
			<img src="/img/2024/20240111-03.avif" class="w-100" alt="Three examples of targets for different levels of players for the straight drive deadball drill." title="Foundation, Competitive and Advanced levels of targets.">
			
			<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Three Quick Reminders</h3>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Heat up properly.  yes, even for solo drills.  You should be sweating BEFORE you hit the ball.</p>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Use the right ball.  If you can't keep a double yellow dot ball hot enough, move down to a single yellow.  Or even a red dot if necessary.</p>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Please consider wearing squash goggles. Eye injuries in squash a rare, especially in solo drills, but your eyes are too valuable to ever take a chance.  By wearing googles during solo drills you allow yourself to become comfortable with them.  Anyway, let's get started.</p>
		
		<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Drill One: Straight Drive</h3>
			  		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Stand anywhere between the short line and near the backwall. Hold the ball in your hand, throw it in the air and hit it at the front wall before it bounces.  if you want to, you can throw it against the side wall or let it bounce first.  Use the target ideas shown above and try to hit the ball within your level's area.</p>
					<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">If you want to you can stick a small taget on the back wall near the floor too.  Your objective is to hit a "<em>second bounce in the nick</em>", but it's more important to hit consistently good shots than lots of terrible ones and then one great one.</p>
					<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Lastly, if you want to, you can hit 3 straight. drives and then try to hit the target area.</p>

		<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Drill Two: Straight Drop</h3>
			  		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Stand between 2 and 3 metres away from the front wall and just like in the previous drill, throw the ball up and hit it into the target aera, shown below.  Keep your swing short and make it <strong>drop</strong> onto the front wall.  I pick up the ball with my racket in a kinda of a scope because that's good for your racket control, but you pick it up by hand if you want.</p>
					
					<img src="/img/2024/20240111-04.avif" class="w-100" alt="Three examples of targets for different levels of players for the straight drop dead ball drill." title="Foundation, Competitive and Advanced levels of targets.">
					
					<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Remember, you are not trying to "kill" the ball in the sense of hitting it hard, you are trying to make your opponent work hard by dragging them forward with such a soft shot.  Aim to make your shot hit the side wall as close to the floor as possible, i.e. the nick, but tightness is more important than a nick.</p>

				<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Drill Three: Serve</h3>
					<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">When you think about it, EVERY serve is a dead ball shot!  Yes, in a real match you would have been running around and trying to win the point, but here you are calm and relaxed.  But, if you can't hit a great serve when you have complete control over everything, it's unlikely you will be able to do it in a match.</p>
					<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I recommend serving backhand on the right side, if you are right handed, because it allows you to flow directly onto the T and keep watching your opponent.  But there can be some benefit from serving forehand such as a different angle, but I suggest 80/90% should be backhands.</p>
					
					<img src="/img/2024/20240111-05.avif" class="w-100" alt="Two examples of targets for different levels of players for the serve dead ball drill." title="Foundation and Competitive levels of targets.">
					
					<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Keeping score or trying to hit a set number of serves in under a certain time can be fun too.
