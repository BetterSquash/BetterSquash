	  		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">In the last few years, I have performed quite a few Video Analysis for club players and one aspect that appears over and over, and can be challenging to communicate, is suggesting a player change something that is seemingly successful or proposing an alternative shot-selection from a shot that was a winner.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">A good example, and quite common, is the reverse angle, often called the “Leisure Centre Boast”.  To an experienced eye, the shot is obvious to see before the player hits it, is in play for longer than a straight push into the same front corner and generally leaves the striker badly positioned.  “But Phillip, it was a winner!” is often a response I hear.  “But the pros play them!” is another one.</p>
			
			<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Success Now Or Improvement Soon?</h3>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">What works well against opponents of certain standards doesn’t always work well against better opponents.  And this brings us to the heart of the problem:  Do you think short-term or long-term?  Want to win a particular match?  Think short-term.  Want to consistently improve?  Think long-term.</p>
	
		<img src="/img/2024/20240118-01.avif" class="w-100" alt="Pro squash players know when to play the unconventional shot.  Original photo by Petteri Repo.  Used with permission." title="Pro squash players know when to play the unconventional shot.  Original photo by Petteri Repo.  Used with permission.">
		
  		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">The moment you move up a level, grade, box or any other form of “standard”, the shots that won you points often become liabilities.  That reverse angle that you loved so much, is now destroyed by your better opponents.  What do you replace it with?  It’s become such an ingrained shot, you can be left with no other options.</p>
		
		<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Does Shot Selection Defines Your Standard, Or Vice Versa?</h3>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">If we were to invent some sort of squash notation that would allow people to “follow” the pattern of shots played in a match, I am convinced that simply by looking at the notation you could judge the standard of players.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Shot selection is a complex subject and many factors influence it.  As a thought experiment, if we put an average club player in the body of a professional, do you think they would play pro-level squash?  Certainly not at the beginning, and maybe not even after a month in the pro body.  We have habits when it comes to the choices we make, irrespective of the body we are in.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Now let’s take a professional squash player and put them in the body of an average club player.  What do you think would happen?  I have no doubt that they would play great squash, even with the limits of the physicality of the average player.  No, they wouldn’t play pro-level squash, but they would play better squash than the average club player in the average club layer body.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"><strong>The key point here is that while the body is definitely a limiting factor, the mindset can override certain limitations.</strong></p>

			<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Serves Are Good Examples Too</h3>
			
	  		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I’ve said this many times before; the better you get at squash, the less aggressive your serves become.  Better squash players often attack serves from weaker players.  Club players often hit hard serves, serves at the opponent, serves down the middle and serves that hit the side wall near the short line.  This variation causes players of similar standard lots of problems.  The receiver struggles to adapt to the variation and often hits weak returns.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Play those same serves against better players and suddenly those serves become easy pickings for the receiver.  It can be such a shift in perspective that the weaker player has no answer.  They haven’t developed a simple high, deep serve that limits their opponent.  I would love to see a heat map of pro serves versus club players.  Changes are that the pro serves would be on average slower and much more grouped.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">In fact, I cheated and created my own.  I took no real data and instead invented what I thought it would look like.  Here is the image.</p>
					
				<img src="/img/2024/20240118-02.avif" class="w-100" alt="If we were to record where club players's serves hit the fllor and the wall and compare it to pros' serves, it would look something like this." title="Absolutely, totally, and completely true heat map of club and pro players serves.">
				
				<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">But It's Not Just SHot Selection</h3>
		  		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I've also seen some pretty strange technical adaptations.</p>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"></p>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"></p>
						
				<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Final Thoughts</h3>
			  		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Mindset and decision-making are as important as ball control and physicality, both for yourself AND how your opponent sees you.</p>
					<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">If you get into the habit of not taking the first few points seriously, then for amateurs, it can be hard to switch gears.  You've probably heard players say things like "<em>Right, that's it, no more mistakes</em>" or "<em>Okay, now I am going to play seriously</em>".  You should never get to that point.  Start seriously and keep it that way.</p>
					<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Yes, you can have a few smiles and laughs along the way, but nothing that would distract you.</p>
