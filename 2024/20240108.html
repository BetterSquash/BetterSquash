So let's look at one way to view your training that will help you decide what to do and what not to do.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">As you have seen from the title, I will address each aspect; volume, velocity, veracity, variety and value, in turn and finish with a key point for you to consider.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">This article is based on a video I made, which is embedded at the bottom of this page.</p>

		<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Volume</h3>
			  		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I have said this many times in the past and I am sure I will say it many times in the future: More training is not better.  Your body needs rest.  Your objective is to find the right amount of training. A lot depends on how much free time you have, how motivated/disciplined you are and other personal details. As a general guide if you are dreading your training for more than a week, then you are probably training too much.</p>
					<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">We need a little dread before training otherwise the training is too easy, but you are not a pro.  Training should bring positive feelings not negative ones.  In addition, feeling physically tired BEFORE training sessions is NOT a good sign.  Listening to your body is absolutely vital and in all honesty, I personally find that aspect very difficult.  That internal mental conversation I used to have with myself before getting ready for training.  Was I being lazy by thinking about reducing the amount of training today or was I being sensible and truly listening to my body?</p>
					<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">It's also worth noting that after training for a month or two, if we haven't seen as big an improvement as we had hoped for, it's natural to want to train more, thinking we are not doing enough.  That's not necessarily the right approach.</p>
					<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif i bg-light-gray pa2"><strong>Key Point: </strong><br>More is not always better.  You should look forward to training, not dread it.  You should be fresh for each session, and if you are not then perhaps you should adjust that day's training schedule to better suit how you feel.  Final thought: over-training is much worse than under-training.</p>
