 	   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   			<p>If somebody said to me "Hey, Phillip!  I did 5 minutes of solo drilling today."  I might say "Well done" if the person never drills or I might say "Is that all?" to somebody who usually spends 30 minutes solo drilling.  But in both cases what they did was <strong>better than nothing</strong>.</p>
   			<p>You could easily argue that 5 minutes of solo drilling is a waste of time.  Especially if it is an isolated incident.  There's no doubt that consistent practice is an absolute must when it comes to improving.</p>
   			<p>But I fear that thinking 5 minutes is a waste of time is not a good mindset.</p>

   			<h2>Everybody Has To Start Somewhere</h2>
   			<p>From the moment I started playing squash, I loved solo drilling.  It suited my character and helped me improve.  Not everybody is lucky like me, and yes, I consider myself lucky that I can perform an action again and again, and not get bored.  Many people feel solo drilling on a squash court is boring, and I do understand that point of view.  Especially when they don't know what they should be doing.  But there are plenty of things they can do to make it more exciting.</p>
   			<p>But everybody has to start somewhere. Making the first step, no matter how small is important.  Building habits and learning to enjoy something requires the first one.  the first step, the first search, the first press up, the first crunch - the first ANYTHING!</p>
   			<p>Is 5 minutes going to improve your squash?  Probably not, but if you start with 5 minutes twice a week, you have crossed a line from "just playing" to "playing and practicing" and that line can be tough for some people.  So if you need a sign to start to do some training - this is it!</p>
	
   		<h2>Never Too Long</h2>
   		<p>One mistake new players make is that they believe that more is better.  And, up to a point that is true.  But you should always end your solo drilling when you are still hitting the ball well.  The moment you start to notice a decrease in quality, it's time to either change the drill or stop.  Any time club players continue after then are not hitting the ball well, all they are doing is reinforcing bad habits or worse making muscle memory of poorly executed swings.</p>

   		<h2>Keep Changing Drills</h2>
   		<p>Make sure you change drills every few minutes.  If you really are going to spend just 5 minutes drilling, make it six and do three 1-minute drills on each side.  I've seen so many people give the advice of "spend 10-20 minutes on each side, hitting the ball to the back".  How mind-numbingly boring would that be for a newish player?  Very!  Never let it get anywhere never being boring.</p>

   		<h2>Not Just Solo Drilling</h2>
   		<p>I've used solo drilling as the main example, but the point stands for other training too.  If you and a friend went on court and played a length-only game for the first 5 minutes of every squash court session, that would be great.  Or if you perform some pairs drills for a few minutes before your match, that would be fantastic.</p>
   		<p>Five minute stretching every day would really help, as would 5 minutes of core or leg strengthening exercises.  Don't think that if you can't perform a full 30 minute training session, it's not worth doing anything.  NO!  5 minutes *IS* better than nothing.</p>

   	<h2>Mindset Is Just As Important</h2>
   	<p>I love this following phrase: "The hardest machine to operate in the gym is the door handle to get in."  Sometimes we just need to turn up and do something.  That mindset is so important. Not avoiding </p>
   	<p>Five minute stretching every day would really help, as would 5 minutes of core or leg strengthening exercises.  Don't think that if you can't perform a full 30 minute training session, it's not worth doing anything.  NO!  5 minutes *IS* better than nothing.</p>
