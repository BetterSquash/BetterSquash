			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">There I was, flicking through the Guinness Book of Squash by Michael Palmer and I came across the following sentences.  "<em><strong>The Gradidge Company, now amalgamated with Slazenger, began making their "N****r" ball for the officer at the Woolwich Barracks, close to their factory, between 1900 and 1905. And in spite of its name, was coloured either white, red or black.</strong></em>"</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">OMG!  There was even an advertisement on the same page showing the name clearly, which I have added to the bottom of the post unedited.  For my video, I edited the word, but I feel that for displaying the original images, I feel it is better to leave them unedited.  At some point though, I my change that view.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">What struck me was the fact it was also available in red and white.  WHy those colours?  In fact, it reminded me of a sentence from another squash book which said that the author used to use pink balls.</p>
			
			<img src="/img/2024/20240420-01.avif" class="w-100" alt="The Gradidge Company advertisement for the N-word ball." title="I don't believe the N-word is sued to describe its colour.">
			
			<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">A Web Search Revealed Nothing</h3>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">As soon as I saw it, I went straight to my computer and performed a web search.  I tried a few different search engines and all I could find were results for the <a class="norm" href="https://www.squashlibrary.info/history-of-squash">World Squash Library</a>, which by the way is a tremendous resource, so huge shoutout to Andrew Shelley for creating and running that, and another one of <a class="norm" href="https://www.squashplayer.co.uk/squash_balls.htm">SquashSite</a>.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Both essentially copy and pasted the text from Michael Palmer's book.  So it looked like I was at a dead end as to why the ball was called that.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">What it did reinforce though was the fact that advertisements from various periods can be incredibly useful for research and an insight into the history of the time.</p>

			<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">The Beginning Of The Rabbit Hole</h3>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">A few days later and by complete coincidence, I was reading The Squash Rackets Annual 1938/39 and came across an advertisement for knit wear and in it, it lists a range of colours that the product is available in.  It listed black and n****r as separate colours, which piqued my interest.  It didn't take long to find another advertisement from the same period using the n-word as a colour separate from black.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">It has been suggested to me that the use of n-word here is for brown or dark brown.  Neither of those colours were listed in either advertisement, so that certainly seems a possibility.</p>

		<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Just To Be Clear</h3>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I want to make it clear that by trying to find out why the ball was called what it was and doubting whether it was to do with the colour of the ball, in no way means I am trying to justify its use.  Clearly, it's a pejorative and there can be no reason to use it.  I feel the example of Warner Bros adding their <a class="norm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censored_Eleven">warning message</a> is helpful here.</p>


		
		<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">A White Ball?  Really?</h3>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Besides the use of the n-word, what struck me as interesting was the fact it was available in white.  Why would they make a white ball?  We use them now on glass courts, but at the time there weren't any.  Well, if you think about it, it makes sense.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">As many of you probably know, squash rackets, now just called squash, came from a game called Rackets.  Rackets was and is played on black walls and a dark floor.  It would seem perfectly logical to believe that at least some of the early courts were made using the same material as rackets courts.</p>
