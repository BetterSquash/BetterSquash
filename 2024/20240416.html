	  		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I often get asked that question.  I get asked it a lot because it's a good question.  The issue arises for two reasons; firstly because a player can't perform a particular drill with their usual ball or, and this drives me crazy, because, often old, "experts" say that if the matches are played with a double yellow dot then all practices should be with a double yellow dot.  That's hogwash, balderdash, poppycock, twaddle and bunk.  In that order.</p>
			
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Training is about manipulating, adapting and adjusting "reality" to allow players to improve.  For example, hitting straight drives to yourself never happens in a match, so if you follow the "experts" advice, then you should never do this in training.  Clearly, that's not true.</p>

			<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Adjust The Difficulty</h3>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Sometimes we manipulate circumstances to make life harder, condition games are a good example.  This is where we restrict or limit the shot selection options to force players to focus on certain shots.  Limiting choices forces players to get better at those shots.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Other times, we manipulate circumstances to make life easier.  if you have trouble getting the ball out of the back corners, then a bouncier ball will allow you to develop a proper swing, which over time becomes more and more comfortable, until you can begin to use a less bouncy ball and recreate real match situations.  if you had stayed with the less bouncy ball, you might never develop that proper swing.
</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Small Steps - making small changes that challenge the player, but still allow them to perform an action with some level of proficiency.</p>

		<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Squash Ball Snobbery</h3>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">There's too much ball snobbery in squash.  In this context snobbery is when players who sue double yellow dots feel superiority over those that don't.  For those people, it's like a "badge of honour".  They say "Oh yes, I use a double yellow dot", as if that means they have reached a certain level of skill.  Often times, there rallies are less than 4 shots.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Use the type of ball that makes squash the most fun.  It doesn't matter if it's solo practice, pairs or group drills, practice matches or serious matches.  of course, in tournament or competition, the type of ball is fixed by the organisers and there is definitely benefit from using this ball for a few weeks before those important matches.  However, you do that to accustom yourself to the ball, not to improve.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Don't think it is an "either or situation".  Using a single yellow dot for some drills doesn't mean you have to use that ball for all of them.  Feel absolutely free to use whichever ball works best for you in each drill or situation.  Of course, using a blue dot, a red dot, a single yellow and a double yellow within the same session is probably not a good idea.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Remember, the choice of ball is partly to do with the temperature of the court as well as the standard of the players.  For a comprehensive explanation of balls, please see my <a class="norm" href="/rightball.html">Right Ball</a> guide.</p>
	
			<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Final Thoughts</h3>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">To summarise, use the ball that helps you improve and/or makes squash the most fun to play.  Don't be bullied by Ball Snobs who think that the double yellow dot is the only ball to use if you want to be a "serious" player.  Don't let them gatekeep you.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">As always, if you have any doubts, comments or questions, just send me an email and I'll respond.</p>
