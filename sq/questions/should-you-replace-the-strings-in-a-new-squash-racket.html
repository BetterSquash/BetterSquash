			<h1>Should You Replace The Strings In A New Squash Racket?</h1>
			<p class="leader">No, not unless you are a high-level or experienced player who prefers a combination of a particular brand and model of string strung at a tension you like.</p>
			<hr class="hr-100O">

			<h2>Some Specifics</h2>
			<p>For most players,  keep the strings in your new racket until:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>They break - Obviously, once they break then they need to be replaced.</li>
				<li>You notice a negative difference in how they feel or play - All strings of all racket sports lose tension over time, especially if you hit the ball hard a lot of the time.  Once you notice a difference in how the strings feel, then that's a good time to change them.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>The Cost Of A New racket</h2>
			<p>Please bear in mind that the cost of a new racket is about 90% the frame.  The strings and handle and grip only consist of 10%.  That means that the strings in your racket are likely to be quite low-quality.</p>
			<p>However, the cost of a restring with good strings can sometimes be 30% or more the cost of buying a new racket!  Now, I am not suggesting you just buy cheap rackets and when the strings break, but a new racket, even though that might actually be cheaper, what I am saying is that only very serious players should consider replacing the strings on a. new racket immediately.</p>
			<h2>What Are The Exceptions?</h2>
			<p>Some new rackets already come with good strings.  Of course, all manufacturers will tell you that the string they used on their rackets is good, but in general, if the racket is mid-range or below, don't believe them.</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.ashawayusa.com/">Ashaway</a> and <a href="https://www.tecnifibre.com/">Technifibre</a> are two well-known string and racket manufacturers that supply their rackets with high-quality strings.</p>
			<h2>Replace or Repair?</h2>
			<p>In the past, it was more common than now to repair a broken string than to replace it.  However, standards have changed and if a stringer offers to repair a broken string, I would recommend you do not accept their offer.</p>
			<p>As I have mentioned, restring can be quite expensive, but repairing a string is more likely to damage your frame, so you should avoid that.</p>
			<h2>Next Steps</h2>
			<p>Taking an interest in your squash equipment is a good investment of your time.  I released a video about <a href="https://youtu.be/KG6ov-q4t04" title="watch a video that explains squash rackets in more detail">Rackets, Balance and Strings</a> that will give you an introduction to the equipment used in squash and how it affects your game.  It explains how most often, volleys require shorter swings before and after you make contact with the ball.  Many new players to squash think that volleys must be hit with full power, but that's not true at all.</p>

						<li>Yes, but if you have a string and tension preference, changing them straight away is fine too.</li>
						<li>No,  it's better to completely replace a broken set of strings.</li>
						<li>That depends on where you live.  Some places are much cheaper than others.  The cost also depends on the quality of the string..</li>
