<h1 class="tcolor">Should We Have A Synchronised Team Squash Drill Championship?</h1>
<h2 class="iheader">Let me start by saying this article was prompted by a dream. I don’t know about you, but I often get ideas when dreaming – some good, some bad. Let’s hope you agree this is one of the good ones!</h2>
<hr class="content">

<p>Honestly, I really don’t know if these ideas are crazy or cool. You decide.  Below is a video taken from Twitter. It shows a group of children in China performing a synchronised bouncing drill with basket balls. It’s both impressive and scary, like a lot of these types of videos. But it got me thinking about whether it would be useful and fun for children to do this on a squash court.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We should do this for squash. <a href="https://t.co/FY5B3CnZOL">pic.twitter.com/FY5B3CnZOL</a></p>— Phillip Marlowe: BetterSquash (@bettersquash) <a href="https://twitter.com/bettersquash/status/1578020033116008450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>Bouncing a ball is a staple drill for getting children and sometimes adults to feel comfortable with a racket and ball. When you first start to play squash, the simple control of racket and ball needs to be developed. Just as driving a car is about control the car itself and then using that ability on a street with other traffic and changing situations.</p>
<p>Getting children to be able to clap at the same time can be hard, so bouncing the ball in time to a leader or with others in the group might be too difficult for younger children, but there are so many variations of the “bounce the ball” theme; bounce and catch, bounce in the air (to variety of heights), bounce on the floor, bounce against a wall etc.</p>
<p>All these take a fair degree of skill and doing them with precise repeatable results is even harder, couple that with doing it in a synchronised group, and hopefully you can see that this quickly develops into a highly skilful activity.</p>
<h2>A National Synchronised Routine Competition</h2>
<p>I couldn’t help myself and wonder whether if it proved popular if a national competition could be set up. A sponsor could be found who would help promote the event and the winning group (could be multiple groups from the same club/facility) would receive some sort of prize (maybe tickets to a pro tournament.
Coaches would start their choreography planning 6 months before the submission time and the groups could spend 10 minutes a week rehearsing their routine. There could be age groupings; under 10 and under 15, but those are just suggestions. The groups would submit their entry routine via video, with clear guidelines for the video and routine.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe there could be an international competition, with each national champion representing their country or state. Yes, I know I am becoming over-excited when we haven’t even tried it, but that’s my personality!</p>
<h2>More Importantly, Would It Help?</h2>
<p>Perhaps the better question is would it actually help improve a child’s skill? I believe it would. Children love competition and challenges, and working in a group/team with a clear objective can be a huge motivator for children. I certainly don’t think that coaches should spend hours and hours on it per week, but a little time drilling the basic racket/ball control couldn’t hurt.</p>
<p>It might be possible for the routine to be practice at home, like many people did during the pandemic, so that might be another benefit. Honestly, the possibilities are really exciting.</p>
<h2>Let’s Take It To The Next Level!</h2>
<p>Putting aside juniors and children for a movement and the synchronised aspect, it also got me thinking about whether it was possible to do some drills with 4 adults and two balls. Not being on court any more with pupils, means that I have to perform thought experiments, but this needs to be tested and adapted.</p>
<p>Imagine the classic 4-person drill, where each player is standing in one corner. A player at the back hits a straight drop to the front and the front player hits a straight drive to the back, and so on, The other two players are doing the same, but on the other side of the court. Now imagine that instead of hitting a straight drive, the players at the front hit a crosscourt. The player would then hit a straight drop. Two balls being used at the same time. Hitting a straight drop off a crosscourt can be hard and hitting the right angle of the crosscourt might be even harder.</p>
<p>Perhaps the above idea is totally stupid, but what if you gave 4 skilled players two balls and said they must create a drill where both balls are being used at the same time. Players are allowed to move or not, that’s up to the group. I don’t know. It sounds fun to try to get working and would certainly require skill and control from all the players. Clearly, nothing dangerous would be allowed, so that has to be considered.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p class="finalsent">I honestly don’t know if this would be cool or not. I do know that any drill that requires skill and timing is useful. There are some many possibilities for drills, routines, music, ways to run the competitions etc, that I can’t help but hope that a few coaches try it. If you do, please let me know what happens.</p>
