<p>All squash courts are beautiful, but some are more beautiful than others. The ones with limited access hold the most interest for me. This short article is the first in a regular series on private and beautiful squash courts.</p>
<p>I recently received an email from a New York resident asking for advice about their squash. They mentioned having a squash court in their building. They use it most weekdays and are thinking of purchasing a ball machine to use. We talked about their options and I asked if they could send some photos. I won’t reveal the exact location, but as you can see from the title, it’s in Manhattan. If you live in New York, you might, just might, recognise the lobby.</p>
<p>Apparently the building was built in the 1920s and as you can see from one of the photographs below in the gallery, it’s a hardball court rather than a squash court, although I haven’t differentiated that in the title. The area is very exclusive, with a duplex apartment recently selling for tens of millions of Dollars. Let me quote the sender to give you some more details.</p>
<p>“<em>As you exit the back door, you are on the lobby area. You proceed to the back and get into a private elevator to the basement. You flick on the lights and descend a rather concerning set of stairs and flick on more lights. The court is accessed by stepping up, something I recall
never having to do. Unfortunately, the court is 18′ x 31′ and the service line is at 20′. There is a basketball hoop and a white three point line painted on the floor. I checked with a squash court builder about bouncing a basketball on the court as to whether it is damaging and he assured me not to worry!</em>“</p>
<p class="finalsent">If I ever get back to Manhattan, I’ll do my best to have a hit on it and post some more photos. In the meantime, enjoy the gallery and a big thanks to the sender for allowing me to use publish the photos.</p>
