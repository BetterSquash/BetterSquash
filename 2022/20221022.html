<h1 class="tcolor">Are All Brands Of Squash Ball The Same?</h1>
<h2 class="iheader">The simple answer is “”NO!”. In fact, the complicated answer is also “NO!”. so how do you choose the right brand for you? Read on to find out.</h2>

<p>There are definitely differences between brands and sometimes even between batches. Some a deader than others, some more lively. For me, and remember I only make squash videos now, no playing or on-court coaching, the most important two aspects are consistency and durability. Honestly, they should be your most important aspects too, but perhaps you have different criteria.</p>
<p>If you were to buy 5 different brands of squash ball all of the same dot, you would find that unless they are made in the same factory, there would be differences. The better a player you are, the more likely you are to notice smaller difference – purely because you have spent more time playing.</p>
<p>It is unadvisable to keep changing brands of balls, unless you can’t find a regular supply. better to find one you like and tick to suing it if you can.</p>
<h2>Leagues And Tournaments</h2>
<p>The first question to ask yourself is “What brand is or will be used for any leagues or tournaments I plan to play in this season?“. Of course, this question is only relevant if you play competitive squash. If you don’t, I’ll talk about your situation in a moment. It’s best to play with that brand because you don’t want the shock of having to adapt to a different bounce profile as well as dealing with a new court and opponent. So, find out which brand they sue and buy some of those.</p>
<h2>Playing Just For Fun</h2>
<p>If you play just for fun then you simply have to see what is available in your area. For example, I live in Spain and Decathlon is the largest sports retailer near me and they sell their own balls. They interestingly sell two types of double yellow dot balls: WSF accredited and not accredited. I found the not accredited balls bounce higher and last longer. The key is <a href="20220606.html">not to use shiny balls</a> and <a href="/rightball.html">use the right ball</a>. If you are playing for fun, play with the ball that makes squash the most fun!</p>

<h2>Dunlop: The BIGGGGGGG Daddy</h2>
<p>I don’t know for sure, but it’s got to be around 90% of leagues around the world use Dunlop squash balls. All PSA tournaments use them as well. In general I like them. People have complained that the consistency has dropped, and that could be true and they definitely feel different when bought over the years.</p>
<p>They have been making or at least selling balls for longer than pretty much any other company and have, at least in Europe, a good reputation. Different countries within Europe may promote other brands, for example Head might be popular in Austria.</p>
<h2>Other Brands</h2>
<p>Most squash brands, at least ones that sell rackets, also sell their own squash balls. I’ve also wanted to buy all the different brands I could and compare them in a video, but it’s not as easy or cheap, as I had hoped. Who knows, maybe I’ll do it one day. My problem is that all the brands I have tried were bouncier than Dunlop and I actually want a deader ball. I’m going to try really hard to get hold of the High Altitude Green dot Dunlop squash ball next year and see how different that is.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to other brands. By all means buy and try them. To my knowledge, and I could be wrong, all other brands have their balls made for them, except Prices and Dunlop. That’s not a criticism, just an observation. it might mean that quite a few brands are all amde in the same factory and just have a different logo printed on them.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p class="finalsent">Don’t worry about the brand unless you are going to play competitive squash in leagues and tournaments. Most popular brands make fairly good balls, so it’s just a case of not worrying too much, buying what you can and making the final decision yourself. If you don’t like a brand, don’t be afraid to stop using it. There’s no “Squash Ball Police” to arrest you! As with all your squash equipment, as long as you are happy, that’s all that matters.</p>
