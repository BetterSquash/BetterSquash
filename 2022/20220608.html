	  	<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Playing doubles is so much fun. I’ve only ever played on a singles court, but at the international level and in some special locations, there are proper doubles courts. Even typing the phrase “Singles Squash Court” seems weird, but the reality is that 99% of squash courts are singles squash courts. Sports like Tennis and Badminton use the same “court”, but use different lines, squash has the same lines but a different court!</p>

		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">As I said in the introduction, if you play squash doubles on a squash singles court it is important that each player has good court awareness, a safe swing and a good understanding of the basics of Lets and Strokes. I spent many happy hours playing doubles against <a class="norm" href="http://www.squashsite.co.uk/pharaohsquash/history.htm">Abbas Kaoud</a> and his son, plus another player and not once did we have an incident.</p>

		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I would recommend wearing squash goggles and being prepared to play more lets than usual though.</p>
		
  	  <img src="/img/articles-008.webp" class="w-100" alt="Two men playing squash" title="Good technique and court awareness are essential for great doubles play">
  	  <p class="f6 sans-serif mid-gray i">This is not a good swing to have in doubles</p>

		<h2 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Can It Help Your Singles Game?</h2>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">ABSOLUTELY. Not only is a it a great game, but being good at doubles has a direct effect on your singles game. To be good at doubles, you need to avoid hitting too many crosscourt – just like singles! You need to keep the ball tight to the side wall – just like singles! You need to use the boast as a way of getting opponents out of position – just. Like. Singles! Get the point?</p>
		
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">The skill comes from playing great shots, not from being super fit or being a fast or great mover. Using the length of a court becomes your main focus, and by using a variety of speed and height you can develop that ability. You also develop patience, because doubles rallies rarely finish in 2 or 3 shots. Lastly, even though I said you need good court awareness, I do believe that your awareness increases from playing doubles. You HAVE to be more aware of the other players on court otherwise not only could it be dangerous, but you might also play the ball to the wrong place.</p>
		
<h2 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I wish it were possible for youngsters to play doubles. I honestly think it would develop into its own personality. As it is, doubles is generally played by older players or because too many players have turned up to a club night, and that’s a shame. Due to my hips and back, I will never ever play squash again, not even conditioned games, but there’s a small hope I might be able to have a friendly doubles match one day. Fingers crossed.</p>
		
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Doubles can be great for developing skills to move your opponent around the court. I highly recommend you try – stay safe though!</p>
