	  	<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">One of squash’s problems is that many courts are never seen by potential players. They are often in private clubs, that are either very expensive or in not well-maintained. In the public sector, i.e. sports centres, squash courts are nearly always in the corner of the building you never walk past them to get somewhere else. It means people don’t see them.</p>
		
	  <img src="/img/squashplus.webp" class="w-100" alt="A squash plus court installation, with roof cover" title="I'd like to try it, wouldn't you?">
	  
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Just think about tennis for a moment. When Lawn Tennis was first created, it was people wanted to be outside, instead of stuck inside stuffy buildings. Not only that, but once something is visible to more people, more people want to try it. At least that’s how the theory goes! Not only that, but many outdoor tennis courts are free to use. So if those two principles could be used in squash, that would help, right? yeah, probably.</p>
		
	  <img src="/img/squashplus-01.webp" class="w-100" alt="Overhead view of the squash plus squash court, next to a padel court." title="Let's hope we see a lot more of these soon">
	  
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Squash+ is a company that was specifically created with the intention of building and promoting outdoor squash courts. They are focusing on two approaches. The first is almost an “off-the-shelf” solution. The image above comes from a padel club in Cáceres, Spain. Where they are continually developing new materials and construction techniques to ensure that this type of court is as effective as possible. That includes cost, maintenance and the ability to even move it.</p>

		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">The second approach is for custom designed courts and surroundings. The image above is a render of a proposed facility with two courts. This type of specifically designed facility would obviously be more expensive than the other approach, but clearly has advantages. What’s crucial is that more people get to see squash in locations that they wouldn’t normally.</p>
		
  	  <img src="/img/squashplus-03.webp" class="w-100" alt="Artist's impression of what a 3 court installation could look like" title="Wow, that's pretty cool.">
		
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Professional tournaments have been erecting squash courts in all sorts of unusual locations; train stations, airports, tops of skyscrapers and possibly the most icon, near the Pyramids in Cairo, Egypt.</p>
		
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I am sure we all wish Squash+ success and can recognise that if squash were able to make the transition to outdoors it would definitely help its image as well as bringing in new players.</p>
