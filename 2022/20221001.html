<h1 class="tcolor">Refereeing Course From Players’ Perspectives</h1>
<h2 class="iheader">Firstly, sorry if this article is a bit of a ramble. I have been thinking about this for a while, but can’t seem to express myself clearly. Here goes…</h2>
<hr class="content">
<p class="detailsp"><em>01 October 2022 <span class="greydash">/</span> 3-Min Read <span class="greydash">/</span> <a  href="https://bettersquash-com.translate.goog/2022/20221001.html?_x_tr_sl=en&amp;_x_tr_tl=es&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">Translate</a></em></p>

<p>The squash subreddit, other forums, facebook groups and in-club discussions often talk about rules, their interpretation and application in real world situations.</p>
<p>It’s clearly an important aspect for the squash community as a whole and for players individually. I have no doubt that the rule-makers within the game have done their best to make those rules as clear-cut as possible, with as little room as possible for interpretation, but you only need to watch a refereeing decision clip and see the difference of opinion, even from very experienced players, to know that it’s still a tricky subject.</p>
<p>If you play competitive squash, then you have probably marked, and for some it’s a minefield, especially with the pressure of spectators standing or sitting next to you.</p>
<p>The fairly newly launched <a href="https://worldsquashofficiating.com/">World Squash Officiating</a> website and course seem fantastic. I haven’t researched much into the course, but the presentation looks great.</p>
<p>But all of the course and resources I have seen, are for refereeing somebody else’s match. Now, I freely admit that knowing the rules and how to interpret and apply them is absolutely essential, but how does that help two players who simply play recreationally?</p>
<img alt="Refereeing Course From Players’ Perspectives" class="responsive" src="/img/wso.webp">
<p>What percentage of matches per year are played with a separate referee? I don’t know, maybe 10%, maybe 50% maybe even 80%! What’s needed are resources and maybe even course purely from the players perspectives.</p>
<p>Looking down on a court from the balcony or through a glass back wall is totally different from standing on court and seeing things from the first-person view. Distances feel different, angles less or more sharp etc.</p>
<p>Ideally, I suppose, courses would be taught from both perspectives and players could make a decision, discuss the reasons, then see a recording from the ref’s vantage point as a comparison.</p>
<p>These courses would be purely for the benefit of players, although, I do feel that refs might also benefit from feeling their decisions from the players limited perspectives.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Honestly, this is never going to happen. The people it would benefit most would be the people who would never take the course anyway, because they won’t see a need if they just play among their friends or colleagues. Who is going to pay money for something like that?</p>
<p class="finalsent">That said, perhaps more consideration could be given to understanding the player’s perspective in refereeing course, and trying to explain things to players while recognising their limited viewpoint.</p>
