<p>Having the right tee-shirt and shorts/skirt is important to ensure you look and feel great. Of course, modern materials also ensure your perform better; either by keeping you cool or by keeping you warm, depending on your needs.</p>
<img alt="The soles of some modern squash shoes" class="responsive" src="/img/use-the-right-squash-shoes.avif" title="Don't choose your squash shoes on how they look, but how they feel.">
<p>Having the right racket, grip and strings is just as important. It ensures you can use all your skills, style and guile to beat your opponent and win the match.</p>
<p>Using the right ball, is essential too if you want to have a squash match that is competitive, but also fun. Play with a double yellow dot that you can’t keep warm and the game becomes boring and not much fun very quickly. Player with a red dot when you don’t need to and it becomes too bouncy very quickly meaning there’s not much running involved.</p>
<p>For more information about using the right ball, please see my in-depth guide: <a href="/rightball.html">USE THE RIGHT BALL!</a></p>
<p>You should also be wearing WSF approved Squash Goggles, but I will be writing about Goggles in future squash articles.</p>
<p>Over the years I have had expensive squash shoes and cheap squash shoes. Luckily, I have been able to adapt to what was available, but without doubt, the best shoes I had were the more expensive squash shoes.</p>
<p>That said, the fit is the most important aspect for me. I would rather have a pair of cheaper squash shoes that fit perfectly than a pair of expensive squash shoes that were not quite right.</p>
<img alt="A pro player reaches high to hit the ball" class="responsive" src="/img/articles-005.webp" title="You have to have confidence in your shoes to jump when playing squash">
<p>The expensive ones would probably last longer, but what’s the point of longevity if they are not suitable?</p>
<p>Nowadays, because I am only on court to make videos and maybe do some coaching, I prefer a more sturdy pair that will last me a long time. When I played competitively, I preferred lighter shoes that didn’t last as long.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p class="finalsent">My final piece of advice is to try on as many different brands as possible. You should be able to quickly tell which squash shoe brand best fits YOUR feet.</p>
