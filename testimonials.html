					<p>"<em>I’ve found Phillip's video reviews super helpful for improving my game. I send him a video every few months and each review/analysis gives me a few clear, practical things to work on, which keeps me improving steadily over time. It’s great having a fresh set of eyes to keep my game moving forward.</em>"<br><strong>D.T., Europe - February 2025</strong></p>
					<hr style="width:50%">
					<p>"<em>"Wow I just watched a few mins of it during my lunch break, the analysis is amazing so far! I'm annoyed I didn't do this sooner!"</em>"<br><strong>M.H., UK - January 2025</strong></p>
					<hr style="width:50%">
					<p>"<em>After just one session with Phillip, I'm very impressed with his coaching. He doesn't beat around the bush – he gave me a great ultimatum that's made me rethink my entire approach to squash. I feel like I'm walking away with a whole new insight into my game. Looking forward to putting these tips to use and to see what lies ahead!</em>."<br><strong>Matt, Australia - August 2023</strong></p>
					<hr style="width:50%">
					<p>"<em>I have worked with Phillip for a while on improving my game and the value for money spent is unbelievable! I did both a video analysis on a game I played along with having solo sessions created. Phillip's knowledge of squash is remarkable and the concepts and tips he gives are things I would never even think of. He has tremendously improved both my ball striking and overall squash IQ. Working with any coach in general will bring improvement but working with Phillip has been fantastic for my game. I would strongly recommend anyone interested in improving their game to give Phillip a try</em>."<br><strong>Fabio, USA - March 2023</strong></p>
					<hr style="width:50%">
					<p>"<em>Phillip’s match analysis is pure gold. It is jam packed with actionable insights and his commentary is entertaining to boot. The product way exceeded my expectations!</em>"<br><strong>Michael, USA - March 2023</strong></p>
					<hr style="width:50%">
					<p>"<em>My playing partner and I have had a couple of virtual coaching sessions with Phillip. We have noticed immediate improvement in our games, and have very much enjoyed Phillip’s insight into our play. Phillip was able to pinpoint a few things that we were unable to see for ourselves. Thank you Phillip!</em>"<br><strong>Charlie, USA - March 2023</strong></p>
					<hr style="width:50%">
					<p>"<em>As a roughly A level player, I was already aware of several issues in my game, but Philip's analysis opened my eyes to a number of problems neither I nor my peers had been aware of previously. He also had simple suggestions on how to fix those problems. His video was over 20 minutes (analysing 5 minutes of play), and he included a detailed e-mail summarising his main points in order of priority. He also kindly responded to a few follow up questions as well. Going in, I didn't know what to expect, but for 25 Euros, Phillip's video service is incredible value.</em>"<br><strong>Andre - January 2023</strong></p>
					<hr style="width:50%">
					<p>"<em>Phillip did a video analysis for a match that I lost. I did not understand why I had lost the match against a similar level player. His voice over commentary on the video was very insightful, sometimes painful, and extremely helpful. He was able to quickly spot 4 areas where I was lacking, showing the issues clearly in specific points, and providing advice on how to address them moving forward. I was very impressed by how he could accurately identify some not totally obvious issues in my game, and very clearly articulate the technical and tactical problems and opportunities. I will certainly use this service again as my game improves.</em>"<br><strong>Domingo - January 2023</strong></p>
					<hr style="width:50%">
					<p>"<em>The service provided by Phillip helped me see rapid improvement in my game.He provided very clear analysis of both the things I’m doing well and the things I need to improve.He walked me through a number of drills I can do on my own to target my weaknesses.In the month since I received my coaching video my player rating has steadily risen, and I feel much more confident on court.I’m sure I wouldn’t have had this success if I hadn’t used his service. I highly recommend Coach Phillip.</em>"<br><img src="/img/henry-holderness.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="The improvement after having video analysis" title="A chart showing how quickly the player improved after having video analysis with BetterSquash"><br><strong>Henry Holderness - January 2020</strong></p>
