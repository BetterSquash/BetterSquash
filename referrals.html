							    <p class="footer"><strong>Questions about the referral program? Contact us at [your email/contact info]</strong></p>
							
							
							
							<p><strong>What’s included in the price?</strong><br>
							<em>One Set includes 12 groups of challenges (6 challenges per group), delivered monthly if in the current set, or delivered in one email if joining late.</em></p>

							<p><strong>Is this suitable for beginners?</strong><br>
							<em>The challenges are designed for intermediate and advanced players, but motivated beginners can also benefit. I recommend trying the free samples to see if it suits you.</em></p>

							<p><strong>Do I have to complete all the challenges in each group?</strong><br>
							<em>No, you can pick and choose the challenges that interest you.</em></p>

							<p><strong>Do I need to watch the Explainer Video?</strong><br>
							<em>No, it's optional. The PDF includes all the necessary details, but the video may provide additional insights into <strong>how</strong> to perform the challenge and <em>why</em> it is beneficial.</em></p>

							<p><strong>Do I have to join the BetterSquash Discord server?</strong><br>
							<em>No, it's entirely optional. The server is there for players who want to discuss the challenges, share progress, and ask questions.</em></p>

							<p><strong>Can I share the PDF with my friends?</strong><br>
							<em>You can share it with a couple of friends, but if you have a training squad or group, please purchase the Commercial Licence.<br>
							This allows you to post the PDF on your facility's noticeboard and make a reasonable number of photocopies.<br></em></p>

							<p><strong>Do I need special equipment to complete the challenges?</strong><br>
							<em>No, most challenges can be done with standard squash equipment. Some solo, pairs' drills and condition games may require targets, but a sheet of A4/Letter sized paper will be perfect.</em></p>

							<p><strong>Can I access previous months' challenges if I join later in the year?</strong><br>
							<em>Yes! When you sign up, you get access to all challenges released so far in the current set.</em></p>

							<p><strong>I have a question not listed here. How can I contact you?</strong><br>

					<h2 class="text-dark">Challenge Categories</h2>
					<h6 data-aos="fade-up">Learn about how each category is different</h6>
					<hr>
					<div class="text-left">

						<h3>Introduction</h3>
						<p>The challenges I supply are not simply "<em>Do x number of shots in this area</em>" or those trending "<em>If you can do this many squats, you are stronger than 80% of the population</em>"</p>
						<p>I want each and every challenge to improve your squash in some way, not just test you. Read on to find out more.</p>
						
						<h3>Solo Drills</h3>
						<p>As you may know, I strongly believe in the power of solo drilling. No high-level squash player has reached their standard without spending dedicated time training alone on court.</p>
						<p>In fact, I offer a dedicated programme called <a href="soloroutines.html">Solo Routines</a>.</p>
						<p>These challenges focus on subtle adjustments to how you perform the drill rather than aiming for specific targets or meeting strict quality standards.</p>
						<p>Some challenges don’t include progressions because they focus on rhythm, control, and feel rather than strict targets or shot counts.</p>
						
						<h3>Pairs' Drills</h3>
						<p>Nearly every club player has practiced a pairs’ drill at some point. Unfortunately, it’s often treated as just a warm-up at the start of a session, reducing its value and impact.</p>
						<p>Like the solo challenges, the pairs’ drill challenges focus on new ways to approach drills. However, unlike solo challenges, pairs’ drills often include quality control criteria.</p>
						<p>My goal is to encourage players to think deeply about these drills rather than just memorising shot sequences.</p>
						<p>These challenges progress from cooperative to competitive, and trust me—cooperative can be even tougher!</p>
						<p>I see these challenges as a stepping stone toward a full Pairs’ Routines programme in 2026.</p>
						
						<h3>Condition Games</h3>
						<p>Condition games impose specific limitations on one or both players. They dictate where the ball can be hit and which shots are allowed.</p>
						<p>The conditions develop excellence. When your shot options are limited, precision and quality become essential.</p>
						<p>These challenges push you to adapt under pressure. The most common condition game, length only, sharpens your ability to hit straight and deep instead of playing unnecessary boasts.</p>
						<p>Unlike other categories, these challenges serve as introductions to the concept rather than redefining how condition games are played.</p>
						<p></p>
						
						<h3>Match Play</h3>
						<p>While these challenges may resemble Condition games, Match Play challenges are never disclosed to your opponent.</p>
						<p>Additionally, they are typically applied to just a few points per game, unlike Condition games, which last the entire game.</p>
						<p>Some challenges restrict your options in specific positions, while others compel you to adopt a particular style of play.</p>
						<p>These challenges are great for playing against opponents who know your game and also encourage you to experiment with new tactics.</p>
						
						<h3>Mindset</h3>
						<p>In the past 20 years, amateur squash players have changed how they train. Specifically, they’ve incorporated more strength and agility training.</p>
						<p>I believe today’s average competitive squash player is fitter and stronger than their pre-2000 counterpart. They began imitating professionals—and that’s a good thing.</p>
						<p>Mindset training is the new strength training. Playing squash for fun doesn’t mean you can’t improve what happens between your ears!</p>
						<p>These challenges will push you to approach certain mental aspects from a new perspective. Some may take you out of your comfort zone, while others will encourage deeper reflection.</p>
						
						<h3>Physical</h3>
						<p>First, I’m not a qualified fitness expert. These challenges aren’t particularly demanding, but use common sense—if something doesn’t feel right, stop.</p>
						<p>This category features unusual exercises designed to add variety to your training.</p>
						<p>You won’t find me asking you to hold wall sits for 3 minutes or do 100 press-ups a day. I hope at least 70% of these exercise challenges are new to you.</p>
						<p>Some help prevent injuries, while others strengthen neglected areas.
							
						<h3>Summary</h3>
						<p>I hope that those explanations give you a better idea of what to expect and also what I am trying to achieve with the Challenges programme.</p>
						<p>I’ll keep saying it, let me know if you have any questions and I will respond as soon I can.</p>
						<p>Thanks for getting this and go <a href="#sample">download the free sample</a> and get challenging yourself!</p>
