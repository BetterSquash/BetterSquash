<!--Introduction Begin-->
<h2>What Is It?</h2>
<p class="finalsent">A monthly 30-minute (more or less) solo routine for <strong>club</strong> players.  Each routine focuses on different aspects of hitting, technique, swing, accuracy, power and control.</p>
<hr class="content"><h2>Why You Need It</h2>
<p class="finalsent">Most players need guidance and objectives when they do solo drilling.  They know some drills, but they don't have a training plan.  Having a plan, <strong>and sticking to it!</strong>, can make the difference between improving and using your time effectively or wasting your time and not improving.</p>
<hr class="content"><h2>What You Get</h2>
<p>Every month, I send you an email that contains a link to the PDF Solo Routine sheet and a link to a brief explainer video (under 5 minutes).  The video does NOT have any voiceover, so you can easily watch at anywhere  and anytime. The PDF can be printed or saved to your mobile device.</p>
<p>The email also contains links to all the previous months' PDF sheets and videos, making it easy to use a different routine if you want to.  In fact, it's a good idea to vary and rotate routines, once you have performed one a few times.  That's also why I give you the December one as a sample.</p>
<p class="finalsent">The email also contains my Solo Drill Guidelines, to ensure you maximise your time on court, as well as a few reminders.</p>
<hr class="content"><h2>How Much Does It Cost?</h2>
<p>The <strong>investment</strong>, yes I do think that's the right term, is 25 Euros for the full calendar year.  It doesn't matter when you join, you get the full year's worth of routines.  So, even if you join in September for example, the first email you get, links to <strong>ALL</strong> the previous routines of that year.</p>
<p class="finalsent">The 25 Euros is for <strong>individuals only</strong>.  If you run a training group or another organisation, including clubs, the investment is 50 Euros per calendar year.  There's no way for me to know whether you are an individual or an organisation, so I will have to trust you.  The Organisation membership allows to make photocopies (within reason - and NEVER sell them) and/or pin the sheet onto a notice board.</p>
<hr class="content"><h2>Sample Routine & Video</h2>
<p>I understand, there's plenty of free training plans floating around the internet and you could even use AI to generate one.  My plans condense my nearly 40 years of coaching into flexible and focused training plans.  In the same way a recipe combines different ingredients into a delicious meal, my routines combine individual drills into an integrated session.</p>
<p>But don't take my word for it.  Try one yourself.  Here is the December 2023 <a class="norm" href="https://bit.ly/47QRQR6">PDF </a> and <a class="norm" href="https://bit.ly/47URqJ6">Video</a>.  Or click the image below and/or watch the video via this page.</p>
<p class="finalsent">PLEASE NOTE: All Solo Routines Videos are set WITHOUT monetisation.  If you see ANY advertisements when you watch the video, that is because YouTube are showing them - not because I have set it that way.</p>

<!--FAQs Begin-->					
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>Here are the questions I have most frequently been asked. If your question is not here, please feel free to contact me and I will do my best to answer you.</p>
<p><strong>How often do I need to perform the routine?</strong> <em>I recommend at least once a week, but if you can do more without sacrificing your pairs drills/conditioned games and matches, then do them more often.</em></p>
<p><strong>What if I find some of the drills too difficult?</strong> <em>Firstly, don't worry.  If everything was easy there would be little point doing it.  Do your best to follow the instructions for the drill and keep trying.  If needed, try a bouncier ball, i.e. from double yellow to single yellow dot.</em></p>
<p><strong>What does "club" player mean?</strong> <em>It can be difficult to exactly define a players level unless they play competitions, and even then each player has different strengths and weaknesses.  By club player, I mean a person who players regularly, probably even in some competitions and has the ability to hit most shots - at least in practice.</em></p>
<p><strong>What happens if I join after January?</strong> <em>Each month's email contains links to all the previous routines of that year, so joining mid-year still gets you access to all the routines of that year.</em></p>
<p><strong>Can I buy this as a present for a friend?</strong> <em>Yes, of course.  Just add their email address when you send the payment.</em></p>
<p><strong>Could you create a personalised routine for me?</strong> <em>Yes, absolutely.  The cost for this is 10 Euros for each routine.  Please contact me and I will ask you some question that will help me create a personalised routine for you.</em></p>
<p><strong>Why don't you offer this as a monthly subscription?</strong> <em>Many things work perfectly as a subscription service, but in this case I decided to make it a yearly cost for two reasons.  Firstly, I feel 25 Euros is a fair one-off price and asking for 2 euros a month seemed silly.  Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, I wanted you to commit to a year's worth of solo drilling.  Of course, joining the programme doesn't guarantee you will definitely use each sheet, but it may help you discipline yourself over the year.</p>
<p><strong>Why are there advertisements on the videos?</strong> <em>As a YouTube creator, I decide whether to monetise any videos or not.  In the case of the Solo Routines Membership videos, I have TURNED OFF monetisation.  Therefore, if you do see any adverts, that's because YouTube has decide to run them - I receive NO monetary return - they keep all the money from the advertisers.  It shouldn't happen very often though.</p>
<p class="finalsent"><strong>Why do you use time instead of shot numbers?</strong> <em>I chose to use time instead of shot numbers because I wanted players to know exactly how long each routine would take them.  You are welcome to perform each drill once and count the number of shots and use that for your guidance.  In fact, I may include my shot number from March 2024 onwards, but only as a guide, not as a requirement.</em></p>
