				<h2 class="f1 lh-solid sans-serif">What Is It?</h2>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">A monthly 30-minute (more or less) solo routine for club players.  Each routine focuses on different aspects of hitting, technique, swing, accuracy, power and control.</p>
						<h2 class="f1 lh-solid sans-serif">Why You Need It</h2>
								<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Most players need guidance and objectives when they do solo drilling.  They know some drills, but they don't have a training plan.  Having a plan, <strong>and sticking to it!</strong>, can make the difference between improving and using your time effectively, and wasting your time and not improving.</p>
								<h2 class="f1 lh-solid sans-serif">What You Get</h2>
										<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Every month, I send you an email that contains a link to the PDF Solo Routine sheet and a link to a brief explainer video (under 5 minutes).  The video does NOT have any voiceover, so you can easily watch at any time. The PDf can be printed or simply saved to your mobile device.</p>
										<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">The email also contains links to all the previous months' PDF sheets and videos, making it easy to use a different routine if you want to.  In fact, it's a good idea to switch around routines, once you have performed it a few times.</p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">The email also contains my Solo Drill Guidelines, to ensure you maximise your time on court, as well as a few reminders.</p>
						<h2 class="f1 lh-solid sans-serif">How Much Does It Cost?</h2>
								<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">The <strong>investment</strong>, yes I do think that's the right term, is 25 Euros for the full calendar year.  It doesn't matter when you join, you get the full year's worth of routines.  So, even if you joining in September for example, the first email you get, links to <strong>ALL</strong> the previous routines of that year.</p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">The 25 Euros is for <strong>individuals only</strong>.  If you run a training group or another organisation, including clubs, the investment is 50 Euros per calendar year.  There's no way for me to know, so I will have to trust you.  For that 50 Euros, you are allowed to make photocopies (within reason - and NEVER sell them) and/or pin the sheet onto a notice board.</p>
						<h2 class="f1 lh-solid sans-serif">See What You Are Getting</h2>
								<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I understand, there's plenty of free training plans floating around the internet and you could even use AI to generate one.  My plans condense my nearly 40 years of coaching into flexible and focused training plans.  In the same way a recipe combines different ingredients into a delicious meal, my routines combine individual drills into an integrated session.</p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">But don't take my word for it.  Try one yourself.  Here is the December 2023 <a class="norm" href="abcd12.html">PDF </a> and <a class="norm" href="efgh34.html">Video</a>.</p>

				<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif" id="vafaq" ></h3>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Here are the questions I have most frequently been asked. If your question is not here, please feel free to contact me and I will do my best to answer you.</p>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>How often do I need to perform the routine?</strong> <em>I recommend at least once a week, but if you can do more without sacrificing your pairs drills//conditioned games and matches, then do them more often.</em></p>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>What if I find some of the drills too difficult?</strong> <em>Firstly, don't worry.  If everything was easy there would be little point doing it.  Do your best to follow the instructions for the drill and keep trying.  If needed, try a bouncier ball, i.e. from double yellow to single yellow dot.</em></p>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>What does "club" player mean?</strong> <em>It can be difficult to exactly define a players level unless they play competitions, and even then each players has different strengths and weaknesses.  By club player, I mean a person who players regularly, probably even in some competitions and has the ability to hit most shots - at least in practice.</em></p>
