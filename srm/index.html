				<h2 class="f1 lh-solid sans-serif">What Is It?</h2>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">A monthly 30-minute (more or less) solo routine for club players.  Each routine focuses on different aspects of hitting, technique, swing, accuracy, power and control.</p>
						<h2 class="f1 lh-solid sans-serif">Why You Need It</h2>
								<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Most players need guidance and objectives when they do solo drilling.  They know some drills, but they don't have a training plan.  Having a plan, and sticking to it BTW, can make the difference between improving and using your time effectively, and wasting your time and not improving.</p>
								<h2 class="f1 lh-solid sans-serif">What You Get</h2>
										<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Every month, I send you an email that contains a link to the PDF Solo Routine sheet - for you to print or save to your mobile device, and a link to a brief explainer video (under 5 minutes).  The video does NOT have any voice, so you can easily watch at any time.  The email contains links to all the previous months' PDF sheets and videos, making it easy to use a different routine if the desire strikes you.</p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">It also contains my Solo Drill Guidelines, to ensure you maximise your time on court, as well as a few reminders.</p>
						<h2 class="f1 lh-solid sans-serif">How Much Does It Cost?</h2>
								<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">The <strong>investment</strong>, yes I do think that's the right term, is 25 Euros for the full calendar year.  It doesn't matter when you join, you get the full year's worth of routines.  So, even if you joining in September for example, the first email you get links to <strong>ALL</strong> the previous routines.</p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">The 25 Euros is for individuals only.  If you run a training group or another organisation, including clubs, the investment is 50 Euros per calendar year.  There's no way for me to know, so I will have to trust you.  For that 50 Euros, you are allowed to make photocopies (within reason - and NEVER sell them) and/or pin the sheet onto a notice board.</p>

		  		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Arh, :(  Because I have only just launched the programme, I currently don't have any testimonials.  If you are happy with the routines, why not send me one so I can display it here.  All you need to send is a brief testimonial, your first name and your country.  Below is a sample testimonial.</p>

		  		<h2 class="f1 lh-solid sans-serif" id="srmfaq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
				<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif" id="vafaq" ></h3>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Here are the most commonly asked questions. If you have others please feel free to contact me and I will do my best to answer them.</p>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>After using this service, will I be able to beat my arch-nemesis?</strong> <em>ABSOLUTELY! Well, possibly. If your video is of you playing him or her, make sure you tell me that you specifically want to beat this player and I will give you tips to not only improve your game, but also counter your nemesisâ€™ strengths and exploit their weaknesses.</em></p>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>English is not my first language, can I still use the service?</strong> <em>Yes, definitely. If I know English is not your first language, I will speak slower, use clearer words and avoid phrasal verbs. Please let me know when you send your initial email.</em></p>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>What happens if I donâ€™t feel I received good value for money?</strong> N<em>otice that you do not pay until AFTER you have received the feedback video. I ask you to pay AFTER because I understand this is a new way to do this. I trust you and I hope you trust me. If you really do not feel that what you got was good value, then you can pay what you think it is worth.</em></p>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>What type of feedback will I receive?</strong> <em>I focus on two aspects: the tactical and technical. I will highlight tactical mistakes you made, but also highlight the correct shot selection too. I will talk about the technical issues you may have and how that affects your tactical choices.</em></p>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>I am a junior, can I still use this service?</strong> <em>Yes, but I require contact and communication through a parent or guardian.</em></p>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>Can I pay with my credit card?</strong> <em>Yes, but I require all payments to go through PayPal. You can use your credit card to pay via PayPal.</em></p>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>Will you offer other ways to pay in the future besides paypal?</strong> <em>Honestly, I do not know. I may consider other payment services if they are easy to work with.</em></p>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>I only have a mobile phone. Can I use that to record my video?</strong> <em>I have received videos recorded via a mobile phone and it was fine. of course, it depends on the quality of your phone and where it is positioned.</em></p>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>Can I see a sample feedback video?</strong> <em>Yes. Here is a <a class="norm" href="https://youtu.be/dsZuSunMvuc">link to a real-world example video</a> which has a short example.</em></p>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>I have a question that is not answered here, what should I do?</strong> <em>Send me an email and I will do my best to answer your question: phillip@bettersquash.com</em></p>
		  		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Starting in <strong>January 2024</strong>, I will be offering Solo Routine Membership.</p>
		  		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">By joining, you will receive a new 30/40 minute solo routine delivered to your inbox every month.  The email will contain the solo drill routine attached as an A4 PDF Sheet; ready to print and use.  The sheet will have a QR code to an unlisted video, which will demonstrate each drill and highlight one key focus element.</p>
		  		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">The cost for the full year is <strong>25 Euros</strong>.  You can join at any time within the year and receive all the previous months' routines of that year.</p>
		  		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Each email I send you will contain links to all the previous months' routines, so you won't have to go searching through your inbox to find them.  And as I just mentioned above, if you join mid-year, your first email will have everything you need in it, including all the links to the previous routines.</p>
		  		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">This membership is designed for the average competitive club player. In the future, I may offer Improver and Advanced memberships, but that depends on feedback and how popular the membership becomes.  In fact, I may also offer pair or group routines specifically for training squads.</p>
		  		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">The PDF Routine Sheet will contain everything you require to perform the drills, but the email will also contain reminders and other notes about the drills and routines.  I may also added a brief paragraph about my recently released videos and articles, as well as anything else related to squash, sports psychology or fitness training that I feel may interest you.</p>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">If you are a club or run a training group, the cost is <strong>50 Euros</strong> per year.  I feel that's a fair price considering you will be sharing the sheet and video among your group.  Of course, there's nothing stopping you from pretending to be an individual, so I will just have to rely on your honesty - for which I thank you.</p>
		  		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I will <strong>NEVER</strong> sell or share your email address with any other individual or group.  I may included sponsored content in future emails, but that will be clearly marked.</p>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">If you any questions about the routines or membership, or would simply like to discuss squash with me, here is my email address: <em>phillip@bettersquash.com</em></p>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I will post a link to the November 2023 Solo Routine here in the first week of December so you can see a sample of the kind of routines I will be sending.</p>
