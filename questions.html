<h2>SQUASH QUESTIONS</h2>
<p class="lead">Asking questions is a great way to learn and in the past, you might have asked your local coach or the better player where you played, but with the internet you can now ask the whole world!<BR><BR>So where do you ask? Well, I favour Reddit and specifically the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/squash/">Squash Subreddit</a>, but there are others.<BR><BR><a href="https://www.quora.com/topic/Squash-sport">Quora</a> is based around the concept of asking questions, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/search/groups/?q=squash">Facebook</a> has some popular squash groups and if you watch any squash videos then you could ask in the comments section.<BR><BR>I'm sure there are others, but those seem the most popular.<BR><BR>Each month, I will select about 5 questions and post my answers in a video.  For each question, I will give you one or two Key Points for you to remember.  No doubt there will be some repetition in the questions asked, but often from a slightly different point of view.<br><br>Links to the original questions are in the text description of the video and if you find a particular question interesting, I encourage you to visit the original question as the other answers may be better for you.</P>

<p class="lead">In this video, I talk about why you shouldn't use old squash balls, why you should use a red dot when you first start to play, why running shoes are the worst thing to wear and how any indoor court shoe will be better.  There's also the topic of how important rackets are and whether hill runs will help you game, but perhaps more importantly, why working on your weaknesses is better.  Then I talk about why tennis-style serves are not useful for squash and finally some information about court movement and how to stop yourself getting stuck between the wall and your opponent, with the ball between you both.</p>
