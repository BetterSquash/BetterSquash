	  	<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Using headphones or earphones in public spaces has become almost as common as having a smart phone.  Go into any gym around the world and you'll find a good proportion of the gym users wearing them.  Isolating oneself and avoiding unwanted contact with other users are some reasons people use them, but perhaps the most common usage is to enhance the enjoyment of the time spent exercising.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Unless you really need to concentrate or focus on a particular task, I am fully in favour of using music to make those workouts more enjoyable.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">It clearly follows that if you enjoy doing something, you are more likely to keep doing it and when you start to see the benefits of exercise, it's even easier to a workout.  So for repetitive exercise that doesn't require much concentration, I highly recommend using music.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">However, what if you are learning a new skill?  Well, then it becomes less clear.</p>
		
	  <img src="/img/headphones-01.avif" class="w-100" alt="A man using dumbbells in a gym with headphones on listening to music, but will it help his squash?" title="People like to use headphones when working out.">
	  
  	<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">My question would be to you is "<em>do you listen to music when playing?</em>"  And the answer to that is almost certainly no.  People often quote studies to me that show many surgeons use music when operating as if that automatically means sports performers should.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">The literature seems to be clear that music can certainly help calm nerves and allow surgeons to perform operation better.  But I am sure you will agree that firstly, there's a huge difference between sports performers playing split-second reaction rallies and most operations.  Secondly, the question is whether music actually helps them LEARN better.</p>
	<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Another point people often use as evidence of using music during solo squash drills, is that many people listen to background music while studying, and it actually seems for a large proportion of students, music really does help.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">It helps lower stress and also avoids distraction.  But as with surgeons, studying is not the same as skill acquisition.</p>

	  	<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">One more point people like to make is that solo drilling is not necessarily the same as skill acquisition.  But are we sure?  We perform solo drills to learn new techniques, refine existing ones and train our minds and bodies so that those shots become second nature to us, or as a lot of people like to say: become Muscle Memory.  The mind has to be a central part of that process.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">It's important to note that my opinion to not use music when performing solo drills comes more from a position of taking the activity seriously and being completely mindful during it.  I fully recognise that music plays an important part in many people's lives and helps in many ways.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">By using music during solo drills, I feel that you are making the activity simply a physical repetition activity and it's not.  It's much more than that.</p>
