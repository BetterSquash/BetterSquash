	  	<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">For those that prefer a visual presentation, there is the video version of the solo squash routine embedded at the bottom of this article.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I call the solo routine I am about to explain to you <strong>"BEAST MODE"</strong>.  It uses some of the most common solo drills, woven into a challenging routine.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">As with many of my routines, there are two core drills that you alternate with.  I designed it like that to keep the routine physically demanding and also to allow you to improve your concentration.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">In future videos, I will show you how to take each drill to the next level, using targets and other ideas, but this is just the basic version.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Before we get started, let me quickly clarify some things.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"><strong>1.</strong> This routine is <strong>NOT</strong> for beginners, improvers, newcomers, novices or even recreational club players.  It is for ambitious, competitive club players.  Hopefully, just like yourself.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"><strong>2.</strong> Heat up properly before you start.  Remember, you should be sweating <strong>BEFORE</strong> you even hit the ball.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"><strong>3.</strong> There is a <a class="norm" href="https://bit.ly/3BfEGic">free poster available</a> for you to download and print to help you follow along with the routine.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"><strong>4.</strong> And lastly, wear your squash goggles.  Yes, even for solo drilling</p>
	<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Mega Set 1</h3>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I start with 50 side-to-side shots. I am trying to keep the ball in the service box width.</p>
			<img src="/img/beast-mode-01.avif" class="w-100" alt="Phillip Marlowe performing the side-to-side solo squash drill" title="Notice the green area: try to keep it in there.">
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Then 50 straight drives on the forehand.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Again, I am trying to keep the ball within the service box width AND trying to make the ball come off the back wall.</p>
			<img src="/img/beast-mode-02.avif" class="w-100" alt="Phillip Marlowe performing the forehand straight drives solo squash drill" title="Notice the green area: try to keep it in there.">
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Then back to 50 side-to-side shots.  Remember, try to keep the ball within the service box width.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Onto the 50 backhand straight drives.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">It's better to focus on control and accuracy than power.</p>
			<img src="/img/beast-mode-03.avif" class="w-100" alt="Phillip Marlowe performing the backhand straight drives solo squash drill" title="Notice the green area: try to keep it in there.">
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">That's one complete set.</p>
			<img src="/img/beast-mode-04.avif" class="w-100" alt="Visual summary of Mega Set 1" title="It's simple but effective">
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I do that two more times.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">When I finish all three sets, I take a short drink break.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I hold the ball in my left hand to keep it hot.</p>
		<img src="/img/beast-mode-05.avif" class="w-100" alt="Phillip. Marlowe holding the ball in his hand in between mega sets" title="Hold the ball in your hand when taking the break">
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Don't stand still though - walk around a little bit.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Back to work.</p>
	<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Mega Set 2</h3>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">50 Figure of eights on the volley
     CP: Prepare early - perhaps early enough to have the racket still, even for a fraction of a second.
50 straight backhand volleys from the middle of the court.
     CP: Make contact with the ball above the wrist
50 Figure of eights on the volley
50 straight forehand volleys from the middle of the court
50 Figure of eights on the volley
50 straight backhand volleys from the front of the court
     CP: I try to force myself to make a mistake by hitting the ball tight to the side wall.
50 Figure of eights on the volley
50 straight forehand volleys from the front of the court
50 Figure of eights on the volley
25 straight forehand volleys from the back of the court
50 Figure of eights on the volley

50 straight volleys, 50 corner volleys, 100 triangle volleys, 50 corner volleys and finally 50 straight volleys.
     CP: I was pleased with this set as I didn't make one mistake.  YAY ME.
50 Figure of eights on the volley
100 side to side volleys</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"> CP: Simple swing, early prep., short follow through.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">It's not shown here, but I like to finish the last few minutes with a soft touch shot.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">You should never walk off court, slump down and get cold.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Well done, you've finished.  Have another short drink break.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I'm not sure of the exact time I took, but it was about 35 minutes I believe.  My arm was aching and I was really sweating when I finished.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I wasn't hitting the ball as hard as I could, but I was hitting it about 80% my maximum.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">It was a tough workout for me, and should be for you too.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">If you enjoyed this video, watch the other videos I made about solo squash drills and routines.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Let me know in the comments if you have any questions or doubts.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Thanks for watching and as always,</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">DO SOMETHING EVERY SINGLE DAY TO IMPROVE YOUR SQUASH CYA!</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">One shot that I rarely see at club level is the high defensive counter drop.  Let's look at each word to ensure we are clear about its meaning.  "High" refers to where it hits on the front wall.  High and soft mean you have more time.  "Defensive" refers to the fact that you are in some way under pressure.  Perhaps that's because the ball is touching the side wall, or you are at full stretch, or even that you are rushed. "Counter" refers in this case to the idea that your opponent has hit a drop shot and you are replying to their drop with another drop. And lastly "drop" refers to the idea of hitting the ball softly and to the front.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">So to summarise: You are playing a drop from your opponent's drop, it's difficult for you to hit it and you hit it high to give yourself the best chance of winning the rally.  Sounds simple, right?  Well, explained like that, it is, but of course in the heat of battle, it's a little harder.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">At first glance, it may seem like you are simply giving your opponent a chance to hit a winner.  And in some ways you are, but we have all experienced that time when all we needed to do was hit the ball away from our opponent to win the point, and suddenly we doubt ourselves, or worse, we over-tjink it and hit  either a tin or a terrible shot.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"></p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"></p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">They have to return the ball in such a way as to limit <em>your</em> options, and the best way to do that is to hit it back in exactly the same way you hit it, i.e. straight down the wall to the back.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">A Rally Reset is often signified by a lob, which will take away the attacking player's advantage, but a lob is not the only way to negate those attacking shots.</p>

		  <img src="/img/lob2.webp" class="w-100" alt="A male squash player lunges to reach a shot and plays a lob" title="Notice how the player in the grey is waiting to pounce on a weak return from Mr. Red.">
		  <p class="f6 sans-serif mid-gray i">About to hit a lob?  Certainly looks like it.</p>
		  
		<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">More To It Than Meets The Eye</h3>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Those rallies up and down the wall are fascinating, at least to me.  In addition to the obvious attempt by both players to force each other to hit a weaker drive, there is also the psychological battle of "Tightness Supremacy".  That's not a proper term, it's just something I invented to describe the situation.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I've written about how the <a class="norm" href="/2022/20220907.html">Side Walls Can Be Your Friend Or Your Enemy</a>, and it's true from beginner to World Champion, although the better you get the more comfortable you are with the side walls.  That's one of the many reasons why even after a very long break, skilful players can return to the court and still hit tight straight drives off tight straight drives - It's a bit like riding a bike: you never really forget!</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I love to encourage my pupils to play condition games, especially the <a class="norm" href="/2022/20221113.html">Alley Game</a>, because it teaches players so much about movement, height, variation and concentration.  In fact, I would absolutely LOVE a world Championship in condition games, where players play the best of three games: Length Only (first bounce past the short line), Right Alley and Left Alley (Both within the service box width).  Do you think the best players would still be the best players?  I'm not sure I do.'</p>

	  <p class="f6 sans-serif mid-gray i">Here are two players NOT playing a serious condition game of squash, and more likely dancing to some imaginary music.</p> 
	  
		<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Back To Club Players</h3>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">A Rally Reset shot is perfect for all levels of players, but the better the squash players, the better the shot has to be - obviously.  At club level, a shot that takes away one player's advantage might simply be a deeper-than-usual drive, whereas at higher levels, it almost certainly is a great shot in itself.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">A rally reset shot needs to give you time, which is why a lob works so well, or it needs to stop your opponent from volleying.  Anything that negates the advantage the player seems to have.</p>

		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">What is important though is the awareness and the decision-making process.  Club players need to quickly accept that they are under pressure and play the shot accordingly.  Too many club players hit the ball with little or even no intention and consequently play the wrong shot at the wrong time.  If you could put the mind of a professional squash player into the body of an amateur club player, that club player would win a lot more matches.</p>

	  <img src="/img/articles-006.webp" class="w-100" alt="A player about to serve" title="Will it be a good serve?">
	  <p class="f6 sans-serif mid-gray i">In many ways, even a service return is a rally reset shot.  You are trying to negate the advantage that the server has.</p>	  
			  
<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Don't be proud, recognise you are under pressure and play a shot that gives you time to recover back to the T and stay in the rally.  Learn to become more comfortable with the side walls and be happy rallying up and down the wall until an opening appears.</p>
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">You don't get extra points for winning the rally quickly, so there's no rush.  Attack when the opportunity is there, otherwise wait for the right time.</p>
