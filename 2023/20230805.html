	  	<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Awareness is very important in improvement.  Getting better requires you to look at what you are doing and make changes.  A lot of club squash players, play matches and hope that somehow they get better.  They do this because when you first start to play a sport, that's often the way it works.  But not after a certain point in standard.</p>
		
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">But what is that "certain standard" I just mentioned?  Well, I can't say for sure because it depends on a lot of factors.  It probably occurs when a player can hit nearly all of the shots in squash, move around fairly effectively and notice different playing styles of their opponents. At that point training other than just playing is required.</p>
		
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">There is something to learn from every match and the idea that you can only learn if you lose is misjudged.  The difference between winning and losing could be just two points (yes, I know that's unlikely: 11-9, 11-9, 9-11, 9-11, 11-9 is highly unlikely, but still possible).  It's not who wins or loses that decides whether you learn or not, it's your awareness.  Do you honestly think you you would learn much if you lost 0-11, 0-11, 0-11?  I don't.  The same if you won 11-0, 11-0, 11-0.  Unless you are put under-pressure, it's difficult to see what needs improving.</p>

<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">As a quick side note: there's a difference between learning and improving.  Learning might mean realising that your forehand straight drop is too high.  Improving means practicing so that you hit it lower in matches.</p>


<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">As I was just saying about pressure, it's the close points that really matter.  The points where you made silly mistakes or made less-than-optimum shot selection. Those are the points that open your eyes to existing issues or possible opportunities to improve.  The matches that push you to your limits are the ones that bring the biggest opportunities to learn.</p>

<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">None of that "learning" and "improving" happen without reflection and analysis.  Playing in close matches, either winning or losing, and simply forgetting about it, brings very little.  You actually need to spend time thinking about the match.  Some players have the ability to remember the crunch points (often where you can learn the most) and objectively assess what happened.  It's generally the last few shots of each rally that really count - the previous ones are just the build up to those actions.</p>

<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Governing Bodies</h3>
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Perhaps the most important guide would be what different governing bodies use.  You could then use that term when referring to sport in that region.  HEre are a few</p>

<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">In Other Languages</h3>
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Perhaps another way to look at this is to see what other languages, besides English, use.  Like the governing bodies section, they might just copy on from each other if they don't have an original word. For example, all Romance languages (Based on Latin) use the Q.</p>
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Here are translations of the phrase "squash racket" in various languages:</p>
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"><strong>Spanish</strong>: <em>Raqueta de squash</em>,<br><strong>French:</strong> <em>Raquette de squash</em>,<br><strong>German:</strong> <em>Squashschläger</em>,<br><strong>Italian:</strong> <em>Racchetta da squash</em>,<br><strong>Portuguese:</strong> <em>Raquete de squash</em>,<br><strong>Dutch:</strong> <em>Squashracket</em>,<br><strong>Russian:</strong> <em>Ракетка для сквоша (Raketka dlya skvosha)</em>,<br><strong>Chinese (Simplified):</strong> 壁球拍 <em>(Bì qiú pāi)</em>,<br><strong>Japanese:</strong> スカッシュラケット <em>(Sukasshu raketto)</em>,<br><strong>Korean:</strong> 스쿼시 라켓 <em>(Seukwosi raeket)</em>,<br><strong>Arabic:</strong> مضرب سكواش <em>(Maḍrab sukwaṣh)</em>,<br><strong>Hindi:</strong> स्क्वैश रैकेट <em>(Skuvaiś raiket)</em>,<br><strong>Turkish:</strong> <em>Squash raketi</em>,<br><strong>Swedish:</strong> <em>Squashracket</em>,<br><strong>Danish:</strong> <em>Squashketsjer</em>,<br><strong>Norwegian:</strong> <em>Squashracket</em>,<br><strong>Finnish:</strong> <em>Sulkapallomaila</em>,<br><strong>Polish:</strong> <em>Rakieta do squasha</em>,<br><strong>Greek:</strong> <em>Ρακέτα σκουός (Rakéta skouós)</em>,<br><strong>Hungarian:</strong> <em>Squash ütő</em><br>Please note that translations may vary slightly depending on context and regional language differences.</p>

<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Nobody enjoys losing.  Many successful people use it as motivation for improvement.  In addition to motivation, use the experience to learn about <strong>your</strong> squash, both the physical and mental aspect, then use that knowledge to update your training plan so that you can turn <strong>knowledge into progress</strong>.</p>
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">From this point forward, walk onto the court and say to yourself "<em>Whatever happens in the next 45 minutes, I will give 100% AND I will learn</em>".</p>
