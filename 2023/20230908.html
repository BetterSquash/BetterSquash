	  	<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Origins</h3>
	  		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">In a reddit comment, <a class="norm" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SophieBio/">SophieBio</a> wrote the following sentence as <a class="norm" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/squash/comments/16a0497/comment/jz5emm1/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3">part of a reply</a> to a question about coaching: "<em>The ABC of squash is not different for anybody. Accuracy. Balance. Control. Lose one, lose the three. Playing squash is about keeping these 3 while making your opponent losing one (hence all).</em>"</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">It's really well put, but it got me thinking about the ABC concept and this article is the result of that thinking.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I find different ways of presenting the same information fascinating.  There is no perfect way or method.  People are different and what feels right for one, may not feel right for another.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Before I talk about the actual A, B and C definitions, I'd like to take a slight detour and talk about the phrase "The ABC of".  It's an English idiom and means the sense of "rudiments or fundamentals (of a subject)".</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Here is an image showing a few variations and their popularity over the years..</p>
			<img src="/img/ngram-01.avif" class="w-100" alt="Google NGram The ABC of..." title="Google NGram The ABC of...">	
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">It was <a class="norm" href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/ABC#etymonline_v_39073">first used in the late 14 century</a>, which is a bit of a shock to me.  Originally, the letters were not actually defined and the text simply covered the fundamentals of a subject.  It's said to come from the idea that children learn the first 3 letters of the alphabet.  So originally, it meant the first things you need to learn, and that is often the fundamentals.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I couldn't find when the letters i.e. A, B and C began to be defined explicitly using words that start with those letters.  It seems like a natural progression though and can certainly help an educator encapsulate the most important information down into three word, and therefore help a learner focus their mind on the key points.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">The acronym "ABC" was also famously used by David Mamet in his 1984 play "Glengarry Glen Ross" for the idea of "Always Be Closing", but the phrase "Always Be..." followed by other words predates the play.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Here is an image showing a few examples.</p>
			<img src="/img/ngram-02.avif" class="w-100" alt="Google NGram for Always Be Closing" title="Google NGram for Always Be Closing">

		<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Squash Books</h3>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Interestingly, in 1934 D.G. BUTCHER wrote the book "The ABC of Squash Rackets", I have ordered a copy but at the time of publishing this article it I haven't been able to collect it.  It will be interesting to see if it defines the letters.  I'll update this article when I have it.</p>
			<img src="/img/abcofsquash.avif" class="w-100" alt="The ABC of Squash by D.G. Butcher" title="The ABC of Squash by D.G. Butcher">
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Oh, one last thing to tell you about squash books.  While searching for that book, I found it available in the library service of Victoria, Australia!  It seems possible to actually order it and read it, which I think is very cool.  In fact, there are other squash books that can be ordered through them too.  Here is the link if you are curious: <a class="norm" href="https://find.slv.vic.gov.au/discovery/fulldisplay/alma994164543607636/61SLV_INST:SLV">https://find.slv.vic.gov.au</a>.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">So back to those letters then.  It seems I have two choices on how to use them.  Firstly, using each letter as a separate word and trying to encapsulate the key elements of squash as in the comment from SophieBio on Reddit or try to find a C word that works well with "Always Be...".</p>

		<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">ALWAYS BE....</h3>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I think I'll start with this format.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">My first option is "<em>Creating</em>", so "<em>Always Be Creating</em>".  Here creating means creating opportunities to put your opponent under pressure or hit winners.  It's the idea that each shot should be hit with that purpose in mind.  Don't hit shots because it's your turn, hit shots to create weak returns from your opponent, which you then capitalise on.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Option two is "<em>Controlling</em>", so "<em>Always Be Controlling</em>".  I suppose that controlling and creating can mean the same thing: the idea that your overriding task as a racket-sports player is to control the court (in squash, the T specifically), your opponent and of course, the ball.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">The next option is "<em>Calm</em>", so "<em>Always Be Calm</em>".  Becoming emotional or over-stimulated is generally not good for your squash.  Playing the shots that frustrate that opponent on that day, rather than your favourite ones is very important.  I suppose what "calm" means here is using your head, not your heart.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">How about "Confident"?  "Always Be Confident" sounds like a great sound bite, but does it really help most amateur players?  I don't think so.  Unless you have been playing and training really well, what have you got to be confident about?  That's not to say that mindset isn't incredibly important in sports, it's just that simply repeating this phrase won't suddenly make you play better.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">This next option fits into the traffic light system of shot selection.  "<em>Always Be Certain</em>".  If you are not totally convinced that this shot is the right time to attack, then play a probing shot instead.  Lack of commitment is possibly worse that choosing the right time to attack.</p><p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"><strong>Honourable Mentions</strong>: I did consider the following options but for brevity decided against including them: <em>civil</em>, <em>calculated</em>, <em>compact</em>.  Asal haters might have added "Always Be Cheating".  But I didn't say that.</p>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">And yes, I did simply look through a dictionary list of words beginning with C!</p>
			
			
			
			
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"></p><p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"></p><p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"></p><p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"></p><p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"></p>



		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">In addition, there does seem to be some belief that the French word was borrowed from an earlier English word, but the English word doesn't have proof it was used to describe the game or implement until after the French word.  As you can see, it's pretty muddled.  If you are interested in the etymology of the word, visit the <a class="norm" href="https://www.oed.com/dictionary/racket_n1?tab=etymology">OED's "racket" page</a>.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">To summarise the origin: We think it's probably French and it used a Q.  But anybody familiar with writing of this period will know that consistent spelling was rare.  Read the <a class="norm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelling_of_Shakespeare%27s_name">Wikipedia page for the spelling of William Shakespeare</a> and to see how even he didn't spell it the same way very often.</p>
		
		<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">British Versus North American</h3>
			<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Some sources will tell you that "racket" is British and "Racquet" is North American.  I hate to say they are wrong, but I will say they are not completely right!  It's true that North America seems to use the word "racquet" but it's also used in the UK too.  A good example is the <a class="norm" href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enES1012ES1012&sxsrf=AB5stBgXCkpKVZVecO33LvI81qgDEntjlA:1691225980476&q=bath+%26+racquets+club&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjZ_7Pek8WAAxWILMAKHfY7DqsQ0pQJegQIDBAB&biw=1440&bih=737&dpr=2">Bath & Racquets Club</a> in central London (I coached there for a little while).</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Equipment manufacturers seem to use the spelling most suited to their location.  Head for example always uses "racquet" and Dunlop always uses "racket".  But you can go to a large, well-known online retailer and see "Head rackets" and "Dunlop racquets", so it really is up to the person writing the text.</p>

<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Governing Bodies</h3>
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Perhaps the most important guide would be what different governing bodies use.  You could then use that term when referring to sport in that region.  Here are a few.</p>
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"><strong>Professional Squash Association</strong> (PSA): This body runs the professional squash tour.  I found examples of both "Racket" and "Racquet" on their site and it seems that they used the spelling from whoever the news cam from.  A good example of this is when the reported on the <a class="norm" href="https://www.worldsportsphotographyawards.com/per-category/year-2023/racquet-sports-23">World Sports Photography Awards: Racquet Sports</a> category.</p>
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"><strong>World Squash Federation</strong> (WSF): This body administers squash around the world.  They control the rules, which the PSA follow, but alos have some minor changes, they specify the technical aspects of the game: courts, balls and rackets.  Like the PSA both spellings can be found on the site, but for all official wording, "rackets" is used.  For example, all through the rules "racket/s" is used.</p>

<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">In Other Languages</h3>
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Perhaps another way to look at this is to see what other languages, besides English, use.  Like the governing bodies section, they might just copy on from each other if they don't have an original word. For example, all Romance languages (Based on Latin) use the Q.</p>
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Here are translations of the phrase "squash racket" in various languages:</p>
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"><strong>Spanish</strong>: <em>Raqueta de squash</em>,<br><strong>French:</strong> <em>Raquette de squash</em>,<br><strong>German:</strong> <em>Squashschläger</em>,<br><strong>Italian:</strong> <em>Racchetta da squash</em>,<br><strong>Portuguese:</strong> <em>Raquete de squash</em>,<br><strong>Dutch:</strong> <em>Squashracket</em>,<br><strong>Russian:</strong> <em>Ракетка для сквоша (Raketka dlya skvosha)</em>,<br><strong>Chinese (Simplified):</strong> 壁球拍 <em>(Bì qiú pāi)</em>,<br><strong>Japanese:</strong> スカッシュラケット <em>(Sukasshu raketto)</em>,<br><strong>Korean:</strong> 스쿼시 라켓 <em>(Seukwosi raeket)</em>,<br><strong>Arabic:</strong> مضرب سكواش <em>(Maḍrab sukwaṣh)</em>,<br><strong>Hindi:</strong> स्क्वैश रैकेट <em>(Skuvaiś raiket)</em>,<br><strong>Turkish:</strong> <em>Squash raketi</em>,<br><strong>Swedish:</strong> <em>Squashracket</em>,<br><strong>Danish:</strong> <em>Squashketsjer</em>,<br><strong>Norwegian:</strong> <em>Squashracket</em>,<br><strong>Finnish:</strong> <em>Sulkapallomaila</em>,<br><strong>Polish:</strong> <em>Rakieta do squasha</em>,<br><strong>Greek:</strong> <em>Ρακέτα σκουός (Rakéta skouós)</em>,<br><strong>Hungarian:</strong> <em>Squash ütő</em><br>Please note that translations may vary slightly depending on context and regional language differences.</p>

				<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Racket Versus Bat or Padel</h3>
					<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">So, what is the difference between a racket, a bat and a padel?  Let me start with my prejudices!  For me, a racket needs to have strings or netting and a bat is solid.  Clear examples of racket include tennis, real tennis, rackets, squash, badminton and racketball, all of which are played in the UK.  Examples of a bat would be table tennis, baseball, cricket, rounders and from Hungary Oină (Yeah, I'd never heard of it either - sorry Oină players.)</p>
					
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">BUT!  And it's a big but, a lot of sports don't seem to follow my simple rule (shame on them).  For example, plenty of table tennis players refer to their equipment as rackets.  A quick search on the <a class="norm" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/search/?q=racket&restrict_sr=1">Table Tennis subreddit</a> shows plenty of people calling them rackets. They also call them bats too.</p>

<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">The other popular sport that doesn't follow my rule is Padel.  They nearly always refer to them as rackets.  By the way, padel rackets can be EXPENSIVE.  Watch <a class="norm" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CKSpbYV3zg">this video to see the 480 Euro racket</a>!  But if you want a designer padel racket, then look no further than the <a class="norm" href="https://www.prada.com/gb/en/p/padel-racket/">£1,380 Prada Padel racket</a>.  Just like squash in the 1980s, Padel seems to attract designer labels.</p>

		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Interestingly, the sport was originally called "Paddle Corcuera"  from the Mexican businessman Enrique Corcuera who set up the first-ever padel court at his holiday home in Acapulco in 1969, and had been adapted from a game played on British cruise ships called "platform tennis" that used tennis rackets.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Exactly how it changed from tennis rackets to solid rackets is unclear, as is how the name changed from "paddle" to "padel".  Perform a image web search for "paddle" and you will find results related to padel as well as water sports.  So some people refer to "padel rackets" as "paddle rackets", but that might just be a mistake.</p>
		
		<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Let's Look At The Trends</h3>
					<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I thought it might be interesting to see what Google Trends shows, so I performed a few comparisons and searches.  If you have a spare few minutes, it's a fun thing to do.  You can compare how often a word was searched for and set some filters, for example by country and date.</p>

<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">In this first image below, you can see that "racket" is more popular worldwide than "racquet".  As you can see, from around 2016, racket really starts to become much more popular. What fascinates me, but I haven't delved deeper, are the peaks and troughs.  Got to be related to sports events or what's on the news, don't you think?</p>
<img src="/img/racketvsracquest-worldwide.avif" class="w-100" alt="Google Trends: Racket versus Racquet Worldwide from 2004" title="Google Trends: Racket versus Racquet Worldwide from 2004">	 
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">The second image shows "squash racket" versus "squash racquet" over the same time period and worldwide as well.  What's quite sad is the obvious decline of both terms.  Also, there's a significant drop for "squash racket", that could be related to the Covid pandemic.  But again, those peaks and troughs match very closely.</p>

<img src="/img/sqracketvssqracquest-worldwide.avif" class="w-100" alt="Google Trends: Racket versus Racquet Worldwide from 2004" title="Google Trends: Racket versus Racquet Worldwide from 2004">	
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Do you think that in another 20 years time, "racquets" will have died away?  If I get time, I might do some more Google Trends comparison articles in the future.</p>
		
		<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Other Meanings</h3>
					<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Racquet" is ONLY used to talk abou the piece of equipment used in sports.  However, "racket" has two other meanings.  Firstly, it means "a lot of noise".  For example, "<em>HEY!  Stop making a racket.  I'm trying to sleep</em>".  The second other meaning is some sort of illegal, fraudulent scheme, enterprise, or activity.  For example "<em>In some countries gambling and alchohol are rackets</em>".</p>
					
	
	<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">The Predecessor of Squash</h3>
				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">You might already know that Squash, originally called "Squash Rackets", and descended from a game called "Rackets".  I've written about <a class="norm" href="https://bettersquash.com/2022/20221111.html">Rackets</a> before, but it makes me laugh every time I have to say a "rackets' racket".</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Lastly on this, it's actually possible to call the game "racket" instead of "rackets", although I don't know if people do.  Super Extra Lastly on this, I have played rackets once and it was fantastic.  So if you ever get a chance, definitely take it.</p>
				
							  
<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">It really doesn't matter, does it?  Racket or Racquet, use what you want.  Which do you use, and why?</p>
