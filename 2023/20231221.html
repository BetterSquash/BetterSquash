	  		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Before you panic and think that this is going to be an academic or scientific paper - relax.  This is a short introduction to spatial awareness in squash and more importantly how it can help you become a better squash player.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Let’s start by defining spatial awareness.  It is knowing and understanding the relationship between your body and the objects around you.  Which sounds pretty simple, and in many ways it is.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Standing on a squash court and looking around, there’s not many objects there, right?  Well, there’s four walls that don’t move.  An opponent who is constantly moving and the ball which should be moving too.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">In addition to those things, there’s “you”.  And in some ways, “you” is the most complex object on the court, in the sense that you can control all aspects of your movement (body, arm and legs).  But perhaps we are getting a little ahead of ourselves.  Let’s take each point in order.</p>
		
		<img src="/img/20231221-01.avif" class="w-100" alt="Amanda Sobhy showing perfect spatial awarness between herself and the ball." title="Amanda Sobhy showing perfect spatial awarness between herself and the ball.">
		
		<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">The Court</h3>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">It’s true that the court doesn’t move, but you do, so knowing where you are in relation to the walls is very important.  The better your squash level, the less you need to consciously think about the walls.  The front wall has little effect on you, but the side walls and back wall do.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">You should be able to place a folded sticky note on the wall and swing and hit it without significantly touching the wall.  Rackets break because they hit the wall, NOT because they scrape the wall.  As a bookend drill I sometimes recommend some <a class="norm" href="https://youtu.be/Kg1Kjrniqm0">wall swings

		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">The back wall can be more problematic for newer players, especially if they don’t have a technically competent swing.  It’s easier to misjudge how close you are to the back wall, especially if you are focused on the ball in front of you.  This is where spatial awareness starts to become important.  Based simply on the visual distance from the front wall AND the lines on the floor, experienced players just “know” where the back wall is.  How confident are you that your racket won't hit the back wall when you swing?'</p>
		
		<p class="f3 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Key Point</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif i">The distance between you and the wall is critical to hitting clean shots.  Spend some time feeling comfortable swinging close to the walls.</p>
		
		<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Your Opponent</h3>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">While you have some control over your opponent's position in a rally, game and match, that really only extends to where you put the ball.  After they hit it, they could move in unexpected ways and to unexpected locations.  Yes, we all expect them to return to the T (assuming both you and they know where that is).</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Some players have the uncanny ability to “know” where you are when you play them, and other players seem completely oblivious to your location.  When you first start to play squash, your total concentration needs to be on the ball and your swing.  There’s no mental processing power left to focus on other aspects.  It’s a little like when you first start to learn to drive a car; actually controlling the vehicle AND being aware of all that’s around you is difficult.  But it does get easier.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"> The sound of your opponent’s footwork can be a good guide, but not always.  In addition, it’s not unusual to see players actually look where an opponent is.  Ideally, you would use your peripheral vision, the sound of your opponent and reasoning based on where you are and where your opponent was.</p>
		
		<p class="f3 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Key Point</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif i">How can you decide where to hit your next shot if you don’t know where your opponent is? As you get better, you will be able to let the swing happen naturally and dedicate some of your attention to your opponent.</p>

		<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">The Ball</h3>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"> When you first start to play squash, judging the bounce, speed and distance to the ball *can* be challenging for some.  Most new players adapt quickly.  As your standard becomes higher, the ball moves faster, giving you less time to adapt.  But the process is the same whether it's fast or slow.  You need to be as close to the ball as necessary, but no closer.  Too close and you have wasted effort and almost certainly limited your shot selection options.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Solo drilling, condition games and simply playing is generally all that is needed to improve your spatial awareness of the ball’s vector (direction and speed).  Let’s not forget that after a ball hits a wall its vector changes and having experience of those changes makes a big difference to your ability to adapt.</p>
		
		<p class="f3f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Key Point</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif i">The ball moves and bounces in consistent ways, but judging your movement in relation to the ball is the key, and there is no substitute for time on court.</p>
		
		<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">You</h3>
	  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Technically, awareness of yourself, i.e. “you” is described as “kinesthesia”, but as I mentioned at the beginning, this is not an academic paper.  Being aware of the exact position of all parts of your body is absolutely vital in the ability to perform a complex action, such as a swing in racket sports.  Even though the racket isn’t your body, it should feel like an extension of it.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">In addition, it’s important to combine this idea with the court, which was our first point.  You have two aspects here, the finer control of judging the distance between your racket and the wall when swinging and the more gross aspect of your position on court.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">There was a time when I performed some ghosting with my eyes closed.  Crazy, right?  Well, the idea was that I should really know where I was based on the movement of my feet.  I don’t use it now as I feel that it’s an extreme that doesn’t help.  I wouldn’t be surprised if pros could do it really well though.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">So for this article, we are interested in your ability to know where you non-racket arm is or the angle of your racket head.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Key Point</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Simply paying more attention to your body and its position on court can allow you to develop habits, such as staying away from the side walls and “hitting and moving” immediately.</p>
		
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Final Thoughts</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">If we are too engrossed in trying to win points or hit the ball hard, we might forget that those things depend on other things.  Squash players generally have good spatial awareness due to the fact that they share a small, limited space with their opponent.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">But by thinking more about your and your opponent’s position on the court, we can develop a better tactical awareness and choose our shots with more thought.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I’m not expecting you to suddenly develop “SpiderMan senses”, but start by asking yourself “Do I know where my opponent is when I play my shot?”.  If not, try to.
	  
		
	  <img src="/img/headphones-01.avif" class="w-100" alt="A man using dumbbells in a gym with headphones on listening to music, but will it help his squash?" title="People like to use headphones when working out.">
	  
  	<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">My question would be to you is "<em>do you listen to music when playing?</em>"  And the answer to that is almost certainly no.  People often quote studies to me that show many surgeons use music when operating as if that automatically means sports performers should.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">The literature seems to be clear that music can certainly help calm nerves and allow surgeons to perform operation better.  But I am sure you will agree that firstly, there's a huge difference between sports performers playing split-second reaction rallies and most surgical operations.  Secondly, the question is whether music actually helps them LEARN better.</p>
	<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Another point people often use as evidence of using music during solo squash drills, is that many people listen to background music while studying, and it actually seems for a large proportion of students, music really does help.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">It helps lower stress and also avoids distraction.  But as with surgeons, studying is not the same as skill acquisition.</p>
	</div>
	
		
			
	<div class="pa4 ph7-l Avenir mw9-l center">	
	  	<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">One more point people like to make is that solo drilling is not necessarily the same as skill acquisition.  But are we sure?  We perform solo drills to learn new techniques, refine existing ones and train our minds and bodies so that those shots become second nature to us, or as a lot of people like to say: become Muscle Memory.  The mind has to be a central part of that process - at least in the beginning to learn those skills.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">It's important to note that my opinion to not use music when performing solo drills comes more from a position of taking the activity seriously and being completely mindful during it.  I fully recognise that music plays an important part in many people's lives and helps in many ways.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">By using music during solo drills, I feel that you are making the activity simply a physical repetition activity and it's not.  It's much more than that.</p>
		
		<img src="/img/headphones-02.avif" class="w-100" alt="A man walking along the street using his headphones, but will it help his squash?" title="Listening to music or avoiding contact?  Maybe both!">
		
	  	<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">A lot depends on your reasons for wanting to solo drill.  I've written about how <a class="norm" href="/2022/20220722.html">Solo Drilling Is My Meditation</a> and you could easily argue that using music when you just want to hit some balls to relax is a good thing.  But how many people use solo drills as meditation?  Not as many that use it to get better.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I no longer play squash, in fact, I only get on court to record videos, and that's less than 10 times per year.  If I were to solo drill purely for the fun of it, I still wouldn't use music, but I also recognise that I no longer use background music of any sort: working on the computer, doing house work, exercising etc etc.</p>
		
		<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Final Thoughts</h3>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">If you are an amateur and want to maximise your improvement, I don't recommend using background music when solo drilling. <a class="norm" href="/srm/">Plan your routines</a> and have clear goals in mind to keep your mind focused.  Concentrate on different aspects of your technique to allow yourself to become more aware of your swing and timing. However, if you just want to have a relaxing solo session, by all means use music.</p>
		
		<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Post Publication Update</h3>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">After I posted this article, I realised I should have mentioned that using music during your <a class="norm" href="/2022/20220809.html">Heat Up</a> is a wonderful thing to do.  It allows you to begin the motivation process and for many, make the process of heating their body up more enjoyable. </p>
