<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I have been using versions of these mantras for many years.  The idea is to simply condense a motivation, technical or tactical point into a short phrase.  Repeating these phrases will help implement them.  Originally, mantras were a form of spiritual meditation, but nowadays they are also part of a process called "<em>self-talk</em>".  If you are curious, you might find this <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/mental-skills-training-sport/0/steps/97572">Introduction to Self-Talk</a> interesting.  It's not simply self-hypnosis, but repeating certain well-thought-out phrases can help you focus on your mind on what is important or help you to control your nerves.</p>
<p>Obviously, you can create your own mantras, especially ones related to mindset and motivation, but be careful about inventing your own regarding technical things - check with a coach or high-level player before you start using it!  If you want to,l send me your mantras for me to check.</p>
<h2>The Mantras</h2>
<p>Some of the mantras have been adapted to be read from the first person to make them more personal.  Others are more neutral or abstract.</p>
<h3>I Do Something Every Single Day To Improve My Squash.</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>I Am Not A Pro, But I Can Train Like One.</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>I Watch The Ball Hit My Strings.</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Probe Or Defend Or Attack: Hit Every SHot With Intention.</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>It's Only A Squash Match.</h3>
<p>The bigger the match, the less nervous I was.  That sounds great, until you realise that even for minor matches my nerves were often the deciding factor, not the squash.  This mantra helped me realise that what was about to happen really wasn't that important. I'm not saying that squash matches aren't important, but it's probably not as important as we think it is.  I stole the idea from Boris Becker when in an interview after losing in Wimbledon (I believe it was his third year playing, after having already won the previous two times), was asked how he felt.  He replied: "<em>I didn't start a war. Nobody died. I only lost a tennis match, nothing more</em>".  My takeways from that, and I saw it live, was "<em>It's just a match - nobody died</em>".</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Words matter.  Say something enough times and you will start to believe it.  If we accept that our viewpoint can be manipulated, why not manipulate it ourselves?  Simply saying "<em>I will be World Champion One Day</em>", won't make you world champion one day, but saying "<em>I work hard every day to reach my goal</em>", might.</p>
