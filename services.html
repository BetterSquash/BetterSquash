				<h2 class="f1 lh-solid sans-serif dark-red" id="vahiw">Video Analysis</h2>
					<h2 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">How It Works</h2>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">You send me a recording of a competitive match and I do a "live recording analysis", which normally last about 15 minutes.  The best type of matches to send me are the very close ones or the ones you lose.  I can perform the analysis on friendly matches, but the opponent must be of equal standard.</p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Use a transfer service like <a class="norm" href="https://wetransfer.com/">WeTransfer</a> to send me the video or link to an online video.  If the video is longer than 5 minutes, let me know the start time you want me to analyse from.</p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">During the analysis recording I talk about tactical and technical aspects of your game, pausing the video to highlight my points.</p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I post the video on my YouTube channel and make it unlisted, so only you can find and see it.</p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">When you are ready to start or if you have any questions, email me. I will reply and give you an estimated delivery date.</p>
						<h3 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif" id="vaprice">Pricing</h3>
								<h3 class="f3 lh-solid sans-serif dark-green">Option 1: 5-minute recording</h3>
								<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">25 Euros <span class="f5 i black">(Analysis video is 15-20 minutes)</span></p>
								<h3 class="f3 lh-solid sans-serif dark-green">Option 2: Custom</h3>
						        <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Send me a complete game or match and I will send you the price.</p>
							
						<h2 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif" id="vafaq" >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Here are the most commonly asked questions. If you have others please feel free to contact me and I will do my best to answer them.</p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>After using this service, will I be able to beat my arch-nemesis?</strong> <em>ABSOLUTELY! Well, possibly. If your video is of you playing him or her, make sure you tell me that you specifically want to beat this player and I will give you tips to not only improve your game, but also counter your nemesis’ strengths and exploit their weaknesses.</em></p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>English is not my first language, can I still use the service?</strong> <em>Yes, definitely. If I know English is not your first language, I will speak slower, use clearer words and avoid phrasal verbs. Please let me know when you send your initial email.</em></p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>What happens if I don’t feel I received good value for money?</strong> N<em>otice that you do not pay until AFTER you have received the feedback video. I ask you to pay AFTER because I understand this is a new way to do this. I trust you and I hope you trust me. If you really do not feel that what you got was good value, then you can pay what you think it is worth.</em></p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>What type of feedback will I receive?</strong> <em>I focus on two aspects: the tactical and technical. I will highlight tactical mistakes you made, but also highlight the correct shot selection too. I will talk about the technical issues you may have and how that affects your tactical choices.</em></p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>I am a junior, can I still use this service?</strong> <em>Yes, but I require contact and communication through a parent or guardian.</em></p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>Can I pay with my credit card?</strong> <em>Yes, but I require all payments to go through PayPal. You can use your credit card to pay via PayPal.</em></p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>Will you offer other ways to pay in the future besides paypal?</strong> <em>Honestly, I do not know. I may consider other payment services if they are easy to work with.</em></p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>I only have a mobile phone. Can I use that to record my video?</strong> <em>I have received videos recorded via a mobile phone and it was fine. of course, it depends on the quality of your phone and where it is positioned.</em></p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>Can I see a sample feedback video?</strong> <em>Yes. Here is a <a class="norm" href="https://youtu.be/dsZuSunMvuc">link to a real-world example video</a> which has a short example.</em></p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif bg-near-white pa3"><strong>I have a question that is not answered here, what should I do?</strong> <em>Send me an email and I will do my best to answer your question: phillip@bettersquash.com</em></p>
						
						<h2 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif" id="vatesti">Testimonials</h2>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif dark-gray i bg-light-gray pa3">"<em>I have worked with Phillip for a while on improving my game and the value for money spent is unbelievable! I did both a video analysis on a game I played along with having solo sessions created. Phillip's knowledge of squash is remarkable and the concepts and tips he gives are things I would never even think of. He has tremendously improved both my ball striking and overall squash IQ. Working with any coach in general will bring improvement but working with Phillip has been fantastic for my game. I would strongly recommend anyone interested in improving their game to give Phillip a try</em>."<br><b>Fabio, USA - March 2023</b></p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif dark-gray i bg-light-gray pa3">"<em>Phillip’s match analysis is pure gold. It is jam packed with actionable insights and his commentary is entertaining to boot. The product way exceeded my expectations!</em>"<br><b>Michael, USA - March 2023</b></p>			
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif dark-gray i bg-light-gray pa3">"<em>My playing partner and I have had a couple of virtual coaching sessions with Phillip. We have noticed immediate improvement in our games, and have very much enjoyed Phillip’s insight into our play. Phillip was able to pinpoint a few things that we were unable to see for ourselves. Thank you Phillip!</em>"<br><b>Charlie, USA - March 2023</b></p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif dark-gray i bg-light-gray pa3">"<em>As a roughly A level player, I was already aware of several issues in my game, but Philip's analysis opened my eyes to a number of problems neither I nor my peers had been aware of previously. He also had simple suggestions on how to fix those problems. His video was over 20 minutes (analysing 5 minutes of play), and he included a detailed e-mail summarising his main points in order of priority. He also kindly responded to a few follow up questions as well. Going in, I didn't know what to expect, but for 25 Euros, Phillip's video service is incredible value.</em>"<br><b>Andre - January 2023</b></p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif dark-gray i bg-light-gray pa3">"<em>Phillip did a video analysis for a match that I lost. I did not understand why I had lost the match against a similar level player. His voice over commentary on the video was very insightful, sometimes painful, and extremely helpful. He was able to quickly spot 4 areas where I was lacking, showing the issues clearly in specific points, and providing advice on how to address them moving forward. I was very impressed by how he could accurately identify some not totally obvious issues in my game, and very clearly articulate the technical and tactical problems and opportunities. I will certainly use this service again as my game improves.</em>"<br><b>Domingo - January 2023</b></p>
						<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif dark-gray i bg-light-gray pa3">"<em>The service provided by Phillip helped me see rapid improvement in my game.He provided very clear analysis of both the things I’m doing well and the things I need to improve.He walked me through a number of drills I can do on my own to target my weaknesses.In the month since I received my coaching video my player rating has steadily risen, and I feel much more confident on court.I’m sure I wouldn’t have had this success if I hadn’t used his service. I highly recommend Coach Phillip.</em>"<br><img src="/img/henry-holderness.webp" class="w-100" alt="The improvement after having video analysis" title="A chart showing how quickly the player improved after having video analysis with BetterSquash"><br><b>Henry Holderness - January 2020</b></p>

				<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif black i bg-lightest-blue pa3">"<em>Feeling that my game had reached a plateau, I reached out to Phillip for his video chat service. It was a great decision which provided me with fresh impetus to continue to work hard at my game. Phillip took time to consider questions I had around technical aspects of my play including movement, shot selection, tactics, and perceived weaknesses. He also identified several new things for me to consider and recommended a revised training plan to get the most from my time on court. Philip was knowledgeable, attentive, and really invested in our discussion and his passion for helping others to improve their game shone through. I would highly recommend this service for anyone looking for a sounding board for questions around their game and how best to progress to the next level.</em>"<br><b>David, Scotland - March 2023</b></p>
